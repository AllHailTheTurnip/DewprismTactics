Biography
Description:Mandolas are viscous plants that lure in unsuspecting victims before attacking them with
their bullet seeds. They tend to live all around, often in murky swamps and on barren cliffsides.|

Appearance:Large green plants with a hinged mouth filled with sharp teeth. On top is a large blossom
of purple flower petals. |

Behavior:Being planted to their starting position, they cannot make movement actions. For this reason,
they do their best to be on their guards, luring in potential prey, and then going in for the kill.|
