Biography
Description:A raggedy duo of thugs. They don't have much in the way of brains, let alone
wisdom, and live entirely to please themselves with meal after the other. Blood,
the elder of the two, is the "brains" of the operation, often dictating what their
next scheme will be.|

Appearance:
Blood: Tall and gangly, with a hard, square jaw, deepset eyes,
and a mouth full of rotten teeth.
He has long grey-black hair that he keeps in a thin ponytail. His skin is tanned and
leathery, filled with long scars from a lifetime of scourges. He carries a machete in a
sheathe that dangles at his side.<br>
Smokey: Short and round, like a tomato, and wearing a red bandanna on his head to boot.
He has the better features of his brother, yet hardly anything resembling charisma or
direction. He wears a shirt the color of sweat and dust, and khaki suspender pants. A
machete much like his brother's dangers at his side.|

Behavior:When deployed to the battlefield, two tokens are created, each bearing the listed VSSA's.
There is no strategy. Their primary objective is to hack and slash at their
opponent until they win or have to make a tactical retreat.
Blood and Smokey each have the same stats, abilities, and equipment. They behave separately
from each other, getting their own initiative scores.
They are both protected by Plot Armor, and when one of them gets knocked-out, a cutscene
is initiated where Blood calls for a retreat and they both flee the scene.|
