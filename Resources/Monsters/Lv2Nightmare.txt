Biography
Description: The utterly enormous equine guardian of Cadamon's Atelier above Carona Forest.|

Appearance: A goliath-sized midnight-blue equine protected by scrollwork armor. It has a
white mane and eyes like little red gems that burn with a supernatural rage.|

Behavior:Once a trespasser gets too close to the doorway, it will drop in from the sky
seemingly out from the blue. If that doesn't crush the trespasser, then the battle will
commence with a flurry of stampedes and hard-hitting kicks.|
