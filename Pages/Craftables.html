        <h1>Crafting and Materials</h1>
        As you collect materials over the course of your adventures,
        you'll reach the point that you can begin crafting new items from them.
        <p>Food, potions, weapons, Ability Scrolls, and even allies can
            be made through crafting. In fact, crafting will become a useful
            allie in your adventuring career.

        <h2>General Crafting</h2>
        Crafting can be a rewarding and convenient means of acquiring useful
        items to use along your journey. However, the process of gathering
        materials
        and processing them together can be just as difficult. The following
        section
        will teach you how to craft and how best go about it.
        <hr>
        <p>
            <b>Rule 1.</b> Any Materials on your person can be consumed raw for
            their base effects.
            However, they won't be as useful as they would be as ingredients. To
            follow a crafting recipe, simply acquire the indicated amount of
            ingredients
            and find a place outside of combat to make a proper Craft Check.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Rule 2.</b> Proper crafting locations include towns, settlements,
            and other safe
            places.
            If you're out adventuring, then your base camp will do. However,
            crafting at night can be dangerous and may draw monsters.
            If you're in a dungeon, then you must have cleared out all the
            enemies
            in the immediate area, found a safe zone, or face a Small Battle
            first.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <b>First</b>, roll 1d20 and add your Craft bonus. If you have any
            tools
            that
            can improve your crafting, add those bonuses too. If your check
            meets
            or exceeds the Difficulty score, you pass.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Second</b>, scoring above the Difficulty score makes for a
            higher-quality craft, while scoring below makes it poorer quality.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Excellent: 12 and Above.</b> The craft is 200% effective.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Great: 6 and Above.</b> The craft is 150% effective.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Great: 0 and Above.</b> The craft is 100% effective.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Good Enough: -1 and Below.</b> The craft is 100% effective.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Poor: -6 and Below.</b> The craft is 50% effective.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Awful: -12 and Below.</b> The craft is 0% effective.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Most crafts have an Effectiveness score, found in between
        [square-brackets].
        As you craft, the Effectiveness score and the final value of the item
        will increase (or decrease) by the percentage above.
        <br><sub>Note: When using fractions, round-down to the nearest
        whole-number.</sub>
        <h3>
            Crafting Ability Mods
        </h3>
        When crafting Ability Mods, you'll be following a different success
        metric than if you were crafting consumables or tools. As a Mod
        is falls in quality, its reliability falters. You can only use it for
        a few turns in each fight before the Ability it is attached to
        runs out of uses.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Good: 0 and Above</b>. The Mod was made successfully.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Tarnished: -1 and Below</b> The Ability this Mod is attached
                to can only be used up to 5 times per fight.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fractured: -6 and Below</b> The Ability this Mod is attached
                to can only be used up to 3 times per fight.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Worthless: -12 and Below</b> The Ability this Mod is attached
                to can only be used up to 1 time per fight.
