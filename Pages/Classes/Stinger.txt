Title: Stinger|
Subtitle: Agile and Piercing|
Description: The name stinger comes from the combative style of the West Heaven imperial guards who
use a blend of puncturing weapons and acrobatics techniques to defeat opponents. In recent years the
style has been migrated across the planet, being adapted to new climates.
<p>
Today, Stingers are generally understood to be fighters that use a blend of poisons, needles,
and good footwork. They can be spotted just about anywhere - especially by the thorns of their armor.
