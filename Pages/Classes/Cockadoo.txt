Title:Cockadoo|
Subtitle:Spirit of Teamwork|
Description:As the saying goes, "Birds of a feather flock together," and the same is true for the Cockadoo. Cockadoos
have traditionally been a nomadic folk, migrating south for the winter with their feathered friends. As per the
tradition of their folk, they dress in color clothes, singing their ancient songs, and bringing delight (and
apprehension) wherever they go.
Cockadoos are believe in teams, and while one Cockadoo isn't much on his own, a team of them can leave ruins. They've
learned from the animals, and they've learned from the land they've traveled for so long - and most of all, they've
learned the value of a companion. Their abilities focus on coordinating and empowering their fellow fighters to
gain the advantage over their opponents, while they themselves have primarily reactionary abilities.|
