Title: Mint|
Subtitle: Brilliant Magician|
Description:
Highly skilled magic users that can actively re-engineer their spells on the fly to suit their every situation.
Their title, Mint, is a vestige to their first days as high-price mercenaries that would cost the buyer "a mint" to
command. Though many Mints today are self-employed and aren't making small fortunes with every gig, their legendary
arcane prowess remains.
    <p>Mints come from anywhere and can be found all around, most often out searching for treasure and glory.
    They'll be acting on someone's behalf as often as they aren't.</p>|
