Title: Bubba|
Subtitle:Muscled Titan|
Description: Names for an island-dwelling god, Bubbas as a warrior-faction
sailed across the world and took root in different nations. However, the life of a Bubbas is dangerous,
and their lives can be short-lived. To become a Bubba is to abandon everything you are in favor of power and power
alone.
<p>
    However, Bubbas that reach their full potential have been known to rival dragons and angels.
    The battle doctrine of a Bubba is one of overwhelming strength. Through the use of raw physical prowess and
    hard-hitting weapons, Bubbas have been known to decimate their unlucky opponents.
