Title: King Ant|
Subtitle: Soldier from the Depths|
Description: King Ant is a moniker that was originally taken by escaped slave-soldiers of the Heaven Kingdom, prior
to nation's split. Conscripted from infancy as simply Soldier Ants, they were raised to be brutal and fearless fighters
 - matched only by their perfect obedience. However, with collapse of the old regime, many slaves found the opportunity
 to flee to freedom, and many did. These new soldiers, possessing only their skills as soldiers,
 took on new titles as King Ants - those who are owned by no one.<br>
 Today, King Ants typically roam in bands of 3-10, though few have been known to wonder solo. They are recognized
 throughout primarily as mercenaries who rarely take a client more than once before setting on their way. However,
 when working as a group, they become nearly unstoppable.|
