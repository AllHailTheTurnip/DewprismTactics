Title:Shadow Legend|
Subtitle:An agile and fearsome ninja warrior|
Description:Shadow Legends are a relic from bygone era - an era of warring shoguns,
and nameless ninjas. In this time, legends such as the Shadow first emerged. He was
 fearsome and magical, possessing the power to challenge corrupt shoguns and rescue maidens
 from fiery dragons. He fought for the poor, humbled the mighty, and brought peace to the
 land.
    Though the time of the Shadow has ended, though who carry on his name and his talents
    continue in the world. Shadow Legends, as they're called, are a wandering bunch, often
    acting solo and moving from town to town, looking for signs of the same war their
    progenitor fought years ago.|
