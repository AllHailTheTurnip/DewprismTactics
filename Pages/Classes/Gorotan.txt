Subtitle:Electrically Charged Hunter|
Description: The first Gorotans were disciples of the feline god Goro, a massive feline
who first created lightning and sent Omnitheon to the abyss in the First of Days. Their
ancient order has existed since the first millennia, and though now it is old and whithered,
these thunderous monks continue live the legend.|
