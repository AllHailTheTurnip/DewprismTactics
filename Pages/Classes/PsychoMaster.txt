Title: Psycho Master|
Subtitle: Mental Warrior|
Description: Psycho Masters are both one of the oldest warrior classes to exist in history, yet one of the newest to truly flourish.
The first Psycho Masters were hermit sages who, in a quest for greater understanding of the connection between the inner world of the mind
and the outer world of matter underwent intense training to bridge the two. Since their first conception, there has only been 1-3 Psycho Masters
throughout history; the student would seek out the master and learn from them, where in time the master would perish and the student would continue
the cycle. Today, Psycho Masters range in the thousands and are spread throughout the world. Their powers are both feared and coveted.
<p>
    Psycho Masters posses the coveted power of psychokinesis. They can reach out from their minds and into the outer world, grabbing
    things and people from far away and toying with them with an otherworldly strength. They can have a range of omniscience and therefor
    spend most of their time with eyes closed. Between their powers and their subdued manners, Psycho Masters make for a frightening opponent.
