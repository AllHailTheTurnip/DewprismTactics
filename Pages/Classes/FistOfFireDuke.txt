Title: Fist of Fire|
Subtitle: Rapid-fire Melee Fighter|
Description: The Fist of Fire branches from the very same order as the Shadow Legends.
The Fists of Fire believe in a brilliant, passionate life. Much like a fire, they burn bright
and hot, often leading them to early graves.
<p>
The Fist of Fire specializes in a close- to mid-range combat,
utilizing special techniques to string together powerful attacks before
their opponent can fit one in.
