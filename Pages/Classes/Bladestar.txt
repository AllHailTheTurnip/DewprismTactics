Title: Bladestar|
Subtitle: Wandering Engineers|
Description: Bladestars are vagabond smiths who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of designing the world's
greatest weapons. And so they travel the world, looking for inspiration and new materials to design with, while putting
their creations to the test in sparring matches and battles.
    Bladestars are champions of the Heart - the inner fire that burns within everyone. Their core belief is that heart
    is what matters most, and just so long as you stoke the fire and believe in it, there's nothing you can't do. Upon
    first glance one might assume Bladestars were mere poet nomads, as by their relaxed wear and their animal companion.
    Anyone who has gotten to know a Bladestar has always gotten to see that beyond the power of Heart really can
    make a difference in the world - and perhaps the future, too.|
