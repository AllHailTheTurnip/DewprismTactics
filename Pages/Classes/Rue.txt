Title: Rue|

Subtitle: Shapeshifting Avenger|
Description:
A stranger surrounded in mystery and enchantment. They possess the disturbing power
to take the form of the recently deceased, often using it to their advantage in fights.
    <p>No one knows where the original Rues came from or where they learned their
shapeshifting trick. Legend has it that they aren't even truly human, instead,
being magical creatures wrought in the shape of humans by ancient magicians.
No Rue has ever given a straight answer to that theory, which seems to be the
only consistent quality that they cling to.</p>|
