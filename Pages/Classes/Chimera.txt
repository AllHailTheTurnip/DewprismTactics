Title:Chimera|
Subtitle: Three-headed Monster|
Description: Chimeras are not natural, but are instead glued together from many living
things, resulting in an abomination. Though there are relatively few of them out in the
world, their reputation is widely known and feared. Their unnatural state has shrouded
them in terror, making them up to be almost demonic.<br>
<p>Truthfully, chimeras are lost individuals in a constant battle for their own
sense of identity. Being sewn together from so many constituents, many tend to
lose themselves later in life, succumbing to a madness that aligns closer
to wild animals than humans.</p>
<p>Most often, chimeras roam the land in search of belonging. However, they have
nothing much to offer - aside from their savage power.</p>|
