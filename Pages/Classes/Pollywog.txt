Title: Pollywog|
Subtitle: Mobile and Adaptable|
Description:
A survivalist found among the harshest environments on the planet. Unfettered by neither land or sea,
    <p>they tend to travel the world from one land to the next, putting their well-earned wisdom to good use
    with one odd job after the next.</p>
    <p>In art and song they've been depicted as eternal travelers, under a sacred oath to live without
worldly attachments and physical possessions. While in this respect it is closer to a matter of
culture, no one can deny that culture of skills that are passed on and nurtured into each
generation of Wanderer has, to some degree, made them ideal for traveling the world.</p>|
