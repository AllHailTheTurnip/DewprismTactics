Title: Wabbit|
Subtitle: Divine soldier.|
Description:Wabbits are group of specially trained martial artists with divine origins. Using a combination of agility,
            acrobatics, and grace, they coordinate to take down their opponents.
            <p>Historically, Wabbits were first trained by a kind of seraphim, warriors from the Overworld who had come to ours on
            a mission of protection for the Elect. They trained the monks of Tomb Hill in the art of divine combat and left.
            The sacred combat arts were passed on from one generation to the next, making way for the Elect to protect themselves,
            that they might worship in peace. Yet it didn't stay that way.</p>
            <p>Defectors of the faith sold themselves as instructors in the Wabbit arts, turning it instead into a tool of all-out war.
            This in turn brought down a judgement and a curse: that whoever practices this art in the name of War shall know nothing
            but war for the rest of their lives. And so the curse rang true. Today, most Wabbit soldiers operate in the employ of
            mercenary guilds, ill-willed noblemen, and as stormtroopers for warlords.</p>|
