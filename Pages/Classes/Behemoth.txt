Title: Behemoth|
Subtitle: Behemoth - Powerful Beast|
Description: In the days of old, the Behemoths were heavenly beasts, tasked with aiding the gods in the creation of the planet.
With great strength they moved mountains, tilled the ground deep and wide to make oceans, and even set the moon in the sky.
When their work was finished, they gods called them into stables deep beneath the earth, never to be seen again.
<p>Yet the mortals who had witnessed their feats never forgot, and from that time on the Behemoths took on a new life.
Today, Behemoths are revered as the foremost champions of strength and endurance, carrying on the legacy of the beasts that once moved mountains.
In addition, they practice the very same magic that once set the moon in the sky, calling upon meteors and whirlpools to crush their opponents.</p<|
