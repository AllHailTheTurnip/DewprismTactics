Title: Witch|
Subtitle: Heavily-Armed Sorceress|
Description: While witches have always been around, the modern witch utilizes modern natural-philosophy to help
make their arsenal not only the most dangerous, but the most unique. Indeed, they have cannons.
<p>
A handful of modern witches understand the power of technology and innovation, and thus seek to incorporate these advancements into
 their arsenals. The heavy cannon is a prime example of this philosophy, allowing them to harness the
 destructive power of modern machinery alongside their supporting magics. In battle, the cannon serves as a
  devastating ranged weapon, able to take out enemies from afar with its explosive rounds. Additionally, the witch's
   ability to levitate the cannon gives her unparalleled mobility on the battlefield, allowing her to chase down
   opponents and deliver powerful blows from unexpected angles. By embracing this fusion of magic and technology,
   the Witch has become one of the most formidable and unique classes in the realm.</p>|
