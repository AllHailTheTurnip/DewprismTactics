Title: Atenacius|
Subtitle: Wizened Master|
Description: During the height of the rule of Aeons, the Atenacious emerged as a caste of combat mages. Chosen from early childhood for
             their innate talents, they were taken and baptized into a world of magic and danger. For the next 18 years they would be disciplined
             for a single purpose: to preserve the arcane arts, no matter the foe.
             	Though the age of Aeons came to an end, the Atenacious persist as protectors of ancient wisdom. They are the perfect
             hybrid of philosopher and magician, displaying a keen wisdom tempered by lethal potential. Though the world is steadily sinking into
             chaos, the Atenacious persist in not just body but soul.
             	Combatively, the Atenacious rely upon necromancy and arcane engineering. Biologically speaking, no Atenaciouses are alive;
             their souls are bound within reliquaries. The ascension from their mortal forms has only served to improve their magical prowess - not
             to mention being effectively ageless.|
