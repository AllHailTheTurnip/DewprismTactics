Title: Mode Master|
Subtitle: Form-stealing Spy|
Description: Mode Masters a modern form of terror that quietly emerged from
the last great war. They are the ultimate insurgent, a master of shape-shifting,
possessing an arsenal of occult techniques to blend in with a crowd. Their
ability to assume any shape they will, to perfectly capture the mannerisms
of their targets, and to quietly weed their way into the trust of anyone they
meet is cause for the paranoia that surrounds them today.
<p>Today, no one knows for sure just how many Mode Masters are really out
there or where they're coming from. For one's own well-being,
it's best to assume that all the Mode Masters are ensconced in the
palaces, plotting against the rulers of this world. But no one
can ever truly be sure.</p>
<p>Worse than thinking there's a Mode Master is after you is actually
KNOWING it. To fight a Mode Master is to fight every person you've
ever loved, to seat yourself so deep in paranoia you can never return from it.
When the time comes, they tend to assume the form of a wild beast in
order to make the murder look like an accident.</p>|
