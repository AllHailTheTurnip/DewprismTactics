Subtitle: Mysterious Mastermind|
Description: The original Doll Masters were first created during the reign of the Aeons
as chief servants. Bereft of individual will, they commanded with their master's authority.
In classical fashion, they are similar to royal
<p>
In combat, they utilize a mixture of magic, technique, and martial prowess to
coordinate their allies and take control of their enemies. They are frustrating
to fight as they are helpful to fight with.

<p> With the disappearance of the Aeons, many Doll Masters simply shut down and
never awoke. However, many defective Doll Masters stayed awake to wander the planet
in search of a new master to serve. However, it shall be known that no Doll Master
has ever forgotten their first master, and long for the day when they return.
