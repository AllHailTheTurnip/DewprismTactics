Title: Evening Dew|
Subtitle: The Ultimate Attacker|
Description: The history of all civilization is bookended by a prophecy - that at the end of days, a lost angel would
return to Earth and drown it fire. Though those times are well off anf the lost angel is nowhere to be found, a following
has regardless formed around them. Their foremost practitioners, styling themselves as Evening Dews, have secluded themselves
hoping and waiting that one day, when the lost angel makes their way back, that they too might ride by their side.
    <p>Evening Dews are masters of mind, body, and will, honing their abilities to cause as much destruction as
    possible. As a backup measure, they are enchanted to return stronger than ever, should they be downed in combat.</p>|
