Title: Pumpkin|
Subtitle: A high-hitting chaotic fiend.|
Description: During the Zhongguo Dynasty, the Pumpkin was a highly valued and feared warrior on the battlefield.
<p>As special soldiers, Pumpkins have been trained in the art of explosive warfare,
 using (you guessed it!) pumpkins enchanted to explode and inflict damage on enemy troops and fortifications.
 Their ability to quickly traverse the battlefield, as well as drop from trees and ceilings have made them invaluable for surprise assaults.</p>
<p>To become a Pumpkin, soldiers would undergo rigorous training in the use of explosives and combat tactics - often losing limbs in the process.
 Today, Pumpkins act as both readily available shock-troopers and farmers, tending the pumpkin fields for their most precious utility.</p>|
