Unique sorcerer of really unique abilities

Title: Dewprism Valen|
Subtitle: Magically Enhanced Monstrosity|
Description: Near the turn of the century doomsday cults started appearing in large numbers all across the planet, either
foretelling of the end or trying to bring it about. The Dewprism Valens were among the latter. They were a secret
society split apart from the Phantom Valens with the grand scheme of bringing about the end of the world.
<p>To do this, they transformed themselves into magically enhanced monstrosities, capable of tackling any force,
 no matter how vast or challenging. Dewprism Valens utilize a mixture of magic and martial arts to grind away at
 their opponent while also enhancing themselves.</p>|
