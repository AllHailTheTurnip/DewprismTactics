Title: Arm of Death|
Subtitle: Bringer of Disaster|
Description: Another relic from the days of the Aeons, the Arm of Death is theorized
to have been a kind of last-resort protector. Their power is both brutal and
careful, where they can direct their destructive energies towards swiftly and quickly eliminating
targets while leaving the surrounding area unscathed.
<p> Once the Aeons disappeared, the Arms of Death that remained were left to wander
the world in search of their master. They know neither rest nor idle, and are constantly
wandering from one place to the next. They kill anything and anyone that disturbs them,
yet are always gone as soon as the act is finished.</p>|
