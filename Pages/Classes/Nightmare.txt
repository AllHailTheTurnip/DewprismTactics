Title:Nightmare|
Subtitle:Stampeding Champion|
Description:Nightmares are the last vestiges of a bygone era, back in a time of renown chivalry.
The first Nightmares were demon-riders, masters of all weapons and, when mounted on horseback, a
force to be feared.
<p>Today, Nightmares are a rare breed, hardly recognizable as a caste, yet unmistakable in combat. They
are thunderous and might like a force of nature. Their supernatural strength and agility
catches most people off guard - often making it seem like they fall right out of the sky. They have been
guardians and warriors - yet wherever one goes, it is wisest to just stay out of their way.
