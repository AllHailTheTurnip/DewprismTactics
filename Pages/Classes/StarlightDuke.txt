Title: Starlight Duke|
Subtitle: High-flying Champion|
Description: The Starlight Duke makes for the third and final betrayal
of the original Duke fighting schools. The Starlight Dukes have forsaken
fury and power, instead looking towards heavenly pursuits - to the stars - for
the source of their strength.
<p>Today, Starlight Dukes are seen as a quirky, if not laughable bunch,
perhaps explaining why their school is so comparatively unpopular to
the others. However, Starlight Dukes demonstrate a serious amount of
defense and persistence in the face of danger.</p>|
