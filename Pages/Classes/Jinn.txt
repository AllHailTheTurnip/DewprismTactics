Title: Jinn|
Subtitle: Reality-bending Spirit|
Description: It was once believed that the Universe was made almost perfect but for a single flaw: one star out of the infinitude was set imperfectly and came crashing down to Earth.
The story goes that one day a lowly shepherdess chanced upon the fallen star. Rather than go on the journey to set the star back in the sky,
she harvested its magic in order to become the new queen of the world. Or so she tried. Cursed by the gods for her selfishness,
the shepherdess was transformed into a wish-granting spirit, imprisoned forever inside an oil lamp.
<p>And so the legend goes. Today, all Jinn profess a lineage tracing back to that lone shepherdess, keeping the story alive and in doing so, saving future generations from suffering the same fate.
Jinns utilize special reality-warping magic to fight their battles. Occasionally, they employ wishes of their own bypass the laws of nature and either raise their allies up the heavens or drag their opponents down to hell.</p>|
