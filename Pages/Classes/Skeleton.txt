Title: Skeleton|
Subtitle: Withered Warrior|
Description: Some believe that the first skeleton was a monk who, after fasting for
30 days, achieved a heightened-state of being and, instead of succumbing to starvation,
became nearly immortal. Before ascending, he taught everything he knew to his disciples.
Later on, when their nation was attacked by raiders and the disciples were scattered
across the empire, they used their knowledge to help them survive.<br>
    <p>While that's still considered a myth, it is absolutely certain that Skeleton
    have their name for a reason. Their fasting has reduced them to skin and bones,
    yet their heightened states have granted power. A mysterious magic surrounds them.</p>|
