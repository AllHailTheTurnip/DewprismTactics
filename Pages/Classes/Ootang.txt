Title: Ootang|
Subtitle: Wild Fistfighter|
Description: Ootangs are out-of-control fighters who specialize in blitzing their
opponents into submission. Between a combination of mid- and close-range attacks,
Ootangs are able to overwhelm their opponents and protect their allies.
The first Ootangs were tree-dwelling warriors from the First Age who observed
the native Ootang monkeys in order to learn to fight like them.|
