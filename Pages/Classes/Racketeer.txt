Title:Racketeer|
Subtitle:Backhanded Fighter|
Description:Racketeers are far from an oddity in the world - they are born and bred in the poorest
pits of society, quietly devouring each other like unborn sharks they are strong enough
to break free. Eventually, they leave their nest and into the searing light of day. Their scars cross
their faces like canyons, their teeth are mangled and stained brown,
their skin is like leather, and their eyes are bloodshot with an insatiable hunger for blood and smoke.
<p>Though not all racketeers go off to become the plight of the civilized world, the few that get wise
and learn to blend in with the commonfolk go on to become sellswords and manhunters. They are are a deadly
mixture of prudence and brutality.</p>|
