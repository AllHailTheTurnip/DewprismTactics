Title: Skull beast|
Subtitle: Persistent Juggernaut|
Description:
A warrior trained in the legendary arts of the Skull Beast - they fear neither defeat nor death. Training begins at a
young age, moulding their mind, body, and spirit to push them beyond normal limits. Over the
course of their training they become well acquainted with pain, suffering, death - and coming back again.
    <p>Today, Skull Beasts tend to travel alone, drawing fear and woe to whichever town they go. Some say they're a bad omen,
bringing bad luck, while others say that they are the bad luck. Who can say for certain? Yet their presence inspires
something instinctual in a person: caution.</p>|
