Saber Tiger
Subtitle Swift and Lethal

Description
Saber Tigers are expert assassins, trained in a variety of fighting methods ranging from
the secret arts to the dark arts.
    Stranger than mere killers, their methodology can be
gruesome and quite possibly sickening, where at times it becomes hard to find respectable
work. Factoring against that, with their reputation for success, Saber Tigers have become
prime commission for crime lords and kings alike.
