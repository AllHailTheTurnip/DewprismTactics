Title: Fire Blob|
Subtitle: Steady Incinerator|
Description: Fire Blobs are hot-blooded warriors who burn everything in their
path. Their combat style is honed from the slow-moving rivers of lava that
erupt from volcanoes. Later in time, as the island nation that first homed
the Fire Blobs was colonized, the fiery warriors found new work as soldiers
for the Royal Army.
<p>Today, Fire Blobs continue their awe-inspiring yet destructive tradition,
carrying the power of the volcano into every fight they enter.</p>|
