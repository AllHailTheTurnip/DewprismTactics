Title: Gudon|
Subtitle: Hotblooded Guardian|
Description: Strong, durable, and focused, gudons are a class of guard that utilize
magical firebreath and good positioning to surprise and subdue heedless invaders.

The first gudons warriors were a tribal folk who lived in caves and learned to fight
by observing the firebreathing reptiles of the same name. As the world outside developed
and colonizing forces eventually found their cave, the gudon warriors were forced into
the world of light for good. Yet rather than assimilate, their warriors put their
talents to the test as security escorts, miners, and hunters. Thanks to their
low-light vision, their natural hardiness in scarce environments, and their unique
magic, gudons made a name for themselves. More than anything, this popularity was
how their culture would survive. |
