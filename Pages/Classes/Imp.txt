Title: Imp|
Subtitle: Enchanted Prankster|
Description: Imps have always been around the world - whether as invisible spirits in the woods and old houses, or
dancing and joking around in the company of wizards. Imps are magical, possessing a sect of magic arts thought
long lost to the mortal realm. However, not all Imps are of impish descent, for there are many folk - mortals like
you and me - who have learned took up the ancient magics. These mortals, also called Imps, carry on the fun
and play of the originals, pranking and joking across the land, wherever the wind should take them.<br>
Or maybe causing trouble for a well-meaning wizard or two.<br>
Imps have more tricks up their sleeves than they know what to do with, and can be either a delight or a
great frustration, depending on if you're on their good-side or not. Surely, they have it in them
to be the sliest thieves, the most cunning of foxes, and the most mysterious of mages - if it weren't for
the fact that every one of their spells was a novelty joke.|
