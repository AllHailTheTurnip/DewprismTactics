Title:Wylaf|
Subtitle:Knight of an Ancient Order|
Description:The Wylafs descend from a great lineage of honor and fighting prowess,
first given to them by the dragon god Wylaf in the First Age. They are
considered the perfect fighters: strong, agile, cunning, and impervious to
all forms of damage. More so, they are bound to a code that transcends
all nobility, making them no man's true friend. They have served for Emperors
and in dark times have dethroned them.
<p>There are Wylaf imitators across the world, but you'll know one when
you meet them. Their stature is perfect, their aura palpable, and their
skill perfect. It is said that they fight with the fury of the dragon gods
of old.</p>
<p>Becoming a Wylaf takes a lifetime of commitment, leaving the
   individual estranged from normal society. By the time their training is
   completed, they can only ever be a Wylaf. Born, raised, and buried
   with their sword.</p>|
