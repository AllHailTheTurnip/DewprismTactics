Title: Cloud Whale|
Subtitle: Master of Wind and Seas|
Description: Cloud Whales were the first ones to master the wind and water.
Following in the footsteps of the original cloud whales, who were monstrous
creatures that lived over stormy seas, the Cloud Whale warriors likewise
learned to control wind and water to defeat their enemies.
<p>Today, Cloud Whales are an oddity, as it's so difficult to train into one.
They typically begin as sea-sidd monks or sailors, who in turn learn
to copy the actual cloud whales.</p>|
