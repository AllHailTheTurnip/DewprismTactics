Title: Gargoyle|
Subtitle: Winged Warrior|
Description: The first Gargoyles warriors were thralls of their gargoyle masters, victims of dark magic that twisted
their minds and bodies. With the demise of their masters, the Gargoyle warriors were set free, and while nearly
all of them lost their dark powers after that, a few noticed that the changes were permanent.
    In the new world, Gargoyles are regarded as strange and fearsome, with harsh skin like stone, fold-out wings
that carry them through the air, and a cry like a storm of knives. It's a wonder why they aren't sought after more.
    Today, you can find Gargoyles as vagabonds - strangers - in a world that doesn't quite know what to do with them.|
