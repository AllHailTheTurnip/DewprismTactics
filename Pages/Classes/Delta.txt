Title: Delta|
Subtitle: Technological abominations.|
Description: Deltas are the persistent tanks of the battlefield. More machine than man, they can replace broken parts
on the fly, while also being able to deliver devastating blows on a whim. While limited to close-range combat, their
natural physical strength and anti-ranged abilities force their opponents into unwinnable situations.
   <p>A Delta's life is defined by brutality. Once just mere peasants living on the dredges of society, they were
   kidnapped and taken to a remote laboratory deep within the ocean to be used in nefarious experiments. Mindwashed
   and surgically mutilated, they were then permanently grafted into iron suits and fitted with augmentations.
    Unable to speak, deformed, and of twisted nature, they live masked lives of quiet, unconscious servitude.</p>
    <p>Sometimes Deltas escape their confinement and wander onto land. Though not normally aggressive,
    they are simple natured, having an animal-like impulse to protect their allies. Some might say they are like
    sharks with the endurance of whales and the minds of birds.</p>|

"It's unnerving to fight a Delta. Whatever punishment you put them through, they just tear off the broken parts
 and replace them with whatever they have available. Mortals, machines - what are they really?"|

A1: Brutal Right-Hook
Melee-Offensive-Action
Use: 10AP+7sta+(1/turn)
Solowork: Increase range by 1sp.
Range: 0sp

"The magician's lightning blast hit dead-on - machine parts and flesh went flying in all directions!
 But in the next moment, the gadget on its back started humming, liquids were being injected, and in the next
  moment the Delta got right back up as if nothing had happened."|

A3: Pressure Resistance
Melee-Defensive-Passive
Effect: At the beginning of your turn create a Pressure counter valued at (1).
Reduce incoming AoE-ranged damage by {Pressure} ranks.
After taking AoE-ranged damage, increase the Pressure counter by 1.
This marker expires at the beginning of your next turn when a fresh marker is created.
"That's your misconception. These monsters were born in darkness at the bottom of the ocean -
immense pressure is their natural habitat."|

A4: Life Pact
Melee-Defensive-Passive
IfKO: This ability behaves as normal.
Effect: At the beginning of combat, choose the allie with the lowest max-health to form a Life Pact with.
If an enemy combatant were to target that allie, then you mark the enemy combatant with a Death marker (max 1 per enemy).
Enemies with the Death marker take an additional 10%(CL) damage from you.
However, whatever negative status effect afflicts your Life Pact target are also shared with you - including KO and death.
"I don't know what happened. The Delta was perfectly healthy, but when that little girl it liked so much died, it fell
into a coma. An hour later, it was dead. Were we wrong to associate intelligence with empathy?"|

"We thought we had the advantage of distance on it - but we were wrong. Reaching out its bulky hand, with palms upon,
a bolt of lightning leaped out."|

"The Delta looked more fit for mining - an easy enough target. But with an unpronounced burst of speed, it leapt right
at us."|

Range: 0sp
Teamwork: Increase Accuracy and Melee checks by +3.
Accuracy: Melee

"It was a classic scenario - overwhelming strength versus overwhelming speed. The rogue just had to leap and dodge
until he won. About midway through the fight his luck ran out. The Delta snatched him at just
the right time - and like that, he was pulped."|

"The Deltas have an instinctive understanding of their own physiognomy, and being more machine-than-man,
it's like they're natural-born engineers."|

Skill-Support-Passive
Effect: You may ignore any negative conditions or clauses in an ability's effect.
"On a conceptual level, Deltas are the ultimate slaves: men made powerful yet forced to labor.

MA2: Enter Abyss
Magic-Offensive-Action
Use: 7mna+(1/battle)
Effect: All spaces on the battlefield become flooded with water up to 10sp high.
Only you are unaffected by the flooding.
"Magic is an act of soul-searching. Deltas aren't supposed to have souls - but I suspect they still do.
I imagine if you looked inside, you'd find the abyss they crawled out from."|

MA3: Genetic Paintbrush
Skill-Support-Action
Use: 10AP+7fcs
Range: 0sp
Effect: Target any amount of combatants within range. You may freely copy up to {CL} extra abilities into your list.
"The part of a Delta that isn't machine is living tissue - but the genes are like plastic, allowing it to adapt
to almost any situation. Imagine what could be done if one were to unlock that power freely?"|
