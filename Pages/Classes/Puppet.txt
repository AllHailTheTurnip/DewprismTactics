Title: Puppet|
Subtitle: Cursed Soldiers|
Description: During their mortal lives they were soldiers bound in eternal slavery to
wizarding masters. Even in death their chains remained; their masters bound their souls
within crude puppets. And so they remained as soldiers ever after, endlessly patrolling
long after their masters had died and the world at large moved on.
<p> Though the practice of soul-binding has long since been outlawed, puppets can
still be found throughout the world, often in long-forgotten tombs and fortresses. Yet
there are other puppets out roaming the open world, often in service to somebody,
and sometimes alone, looking for someone to call their master.
</p><p>
No puppet remembers who they were in their past life, but much of their character - personality,
quirks, and behaviors - persists. They are rational creatures with irrational natures:
they can reason and make weighted decisions, but their inmost natures decree that they
should serve a master. There are legends of puppets who have had their eternal chains broken,
but they are just legends.
