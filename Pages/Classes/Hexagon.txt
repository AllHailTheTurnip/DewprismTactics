Title: Hexagon|
Subtitle: Indestructible Guardian|
Description: Hexagons are the unstoppable warriors of the battlefield. Their impregnable hulls and their gift
of flight made them as terrifying wards of chaos. A millennia ago they served on behalf of their Aeon masters,
but today they are few and far between, lost to the sands of time, or to wandering the earth.

Legend has it the first Hexagons were made from rogue magicians who, once captured, were robbed of their
wills, and had their bodies replaced with hulking metal suits. Trapped inside without any will but that of their
masters, they were cursed to a false life for the rest of eternity.|
