Title:Mandola|
Subtitle:Evergreen Sentinel|
Description:The Mandola is a type of fighter named for the viscious Mandola plants that grow in rocky
terrain. The plants, which adapted through the years to cling to life and fight with bullet seeds and
sharp teeth, live on in the legacy of the new Mandolas. They are part herbalist, part sniper. and part
guard tower.
<p>
The Mandola's creed is to protect without flaw. They stay their ground, rooted like plants, turning
any hostile environment into their home. Many of them have even discovered the secrets of natural
regeneration and can recover from just about any injury in a matter of minutes. Yet like all plants,
no Mandola is truly ever the same, as they vary from region to region. </p>|
