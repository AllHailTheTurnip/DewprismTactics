Title: Specter|
Subtitle: Otherworldly Terror|
Description: A kind of ghost, Specters have carried nothing with them from their past life except for their anger and
suffering - as to the cause of that, not even they know. And so, they wander the earth looking for a solution, often
spending an eternity in a strange and alien world.<br>
When a specter comes around the room becomes cold and fires go out. Their breath can paralyze you and their touch can
turn you to ice. Walls, barriers, and mundane weapons mean nothing to them.<br>
Despite their pain and suffering, not all Specters are monsters, but in time, they all go that way. A young Specter is
blessed with the chance to redeem their immortal souls and pass onto the next life
- hopefully, they don't run out of time.|
