Title: Specter|
Subtitle: Otherworldly Terror|
Description: A kind of ghost, Specters have carried nothing with them from their past life except for their anger and
suffering - as to the cause of that, not even they know. And so, they wander the earth looking for a solution - often
spending an eternity in a strange and increasingly-alien world.<br>
When a specter comes around the room becomes cold and fires go out. Their breath can paralyze you and their touch can
turn you to ice. Walls, barriers, and mundane weapons mean nothing to them.<br>
Specters come into the world with no memories of their past lives, but they are rational and coherent enough to know
what must be done. Only if they can solve the mystery of their past-live's miseries will they be able to pass on into
the next one - that is, if they don't go mad before then.|
