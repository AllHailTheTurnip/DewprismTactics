Title: Shaolon|
Subtitle: Bloodthirsty Raptor|
Description: Originally meaning "Talon", Shaolons utilize an arsenal of sharp weapons
inspired by raptors such as hawks and eagles. Their kind first appeared in the eastern barrenlands as private assassins
for the Patriarchs, but during the turn of the millennium their reign came to an end and the disenfranchised Shaolons sought employment under the highest bidders.
 The history of the Shaolon is stained in blood, where at no point does it seem to have found redemption. A Shaolon's
 doctrine is defined by a kind of reptilian pragmatism, where there exists no other hierarchy than prey and predator - the devourer and the devoured.
 Like most animals, Shaolons have adapted to the modern world. They serve in the rotted belly of the underworld,
 hired killers of ill regard.|
