    Adventuring
</h1>
<div class="Side">
    A treasure hunter's life is one of danger and excitement. You'll be traveling
    the world in search of ancient wonders and hidden mysteries - things that
    bewilder and capture the imagination. Hoards of monsters, lethal traps, dungeon
    bosses, and so much more stand in your way. Yet, the dangers have their rewards:
    treasures of gold and jewels, magical items, powerful weapons, and world-altering
    revelations to secrets untold.<br>
    Yet, for a life so filled with excitement, everyone needs downtime. And so, in
    between escapades, treasure hunters can be found resting and preparing. The world
    is peppered with towns, cities, and various outposts. Find an inn, get a good sleep
    and have a nice meal; stop by the smith and upgrade your equipment, and maybe
    head out for some training.<br>
    It's all about balance.

    Civilization

During your travels, you'll come across towns and cities where you can rest, relax,
and enjoy a quiet day. During your stay can do some shopping, learn the latest rumors,
and visit a guild for some extra work.
<h2>
    Rest and Recovery
</h2>
<p>
    As a general rule, just so long as you have some kind of bedroll, you can lay down
    for some rest. While resting, all your Health, Mana, Stamina, and Focus are restored,
    and you wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day ahead. However, there are
    different degrees of rest you can get.
</p>

<p>
    To make it clear - negative status effects that may have lasted from your most recent battle remain in effect.<br>
    In order to remove any negative status effects, go visit a doctor.
</p>
<h3>
    Good Rest
</h3>
Sleeping for eight hours in a warm, comfortable bed in a safe environment grants you the benefits of
a good rest.
<p>
    With a good rest, you gain a temporary +10% bonus to your maximum Vital scores. These
    last until they're lost, and cannot be restored through any means.
</p>
<h3>
    Great Rest
</h3>
Better than a Good Rest, you must sleep in a luxurious room with a great bed
for eight or more hours to get the benefits of a Great Rest.
<p>
    With a Great Rest, you gain a temporary +20% bonus to your maximum Vital scores. This
    bonus cannot be restored through any means.
</p>
<h3>
    Leveling Up
</h3>
<p>Now that you've rested for 3-6+ hours, you can finally level-up.<br>
    After you've finished your rest, if you've acquired enough experience points to meet or exceed the requirements,
    you can level-up. By doing so, you subtract the required amount from your current XP,
    and you follow the level-up process as described in <a href="LevelsAndProgression.html">Levels and
        Progression</a>.<br></p>
<b>Please note: If you have not rested, you cannot level-up.</b>
<h3>
    Doctor
</h3>
Just about every town has a doctor. These specialists are able to help restore you to
full health after a hard battle. Aside from restoring your vitals, they primarily
restore status conditions, such as poison, or disablement.
<p>
    Once in town, you can consult the doctor and pay a flat fee for their services.

    It only takes an hour to remedy any amount of afflictions.

<h3>
    Inns and Hotels
</h3>
Inns and hotels are establishments that provide rooms for overnight use. While resting
there, you gain the benefits of a good rest, along with other complimentary services
they might provide.
<p>
    Inns differ from hotels in that they are less formal and focus more on simple provisions.
</p>
<p>
    Hotels on the other hand, are focused on luxurious conditions and comfortable accommodations.
</p>
<p>
    In order to get the benefits of either establishment, you must spend the night there
    and get at least 8 hours of sleep.

<h3>
    The Church
</h3>
A JRPG just isn't complete with its vaguely-Catholic church. Just about every large
town has some kind of a church establishment where you can sit and reflect on your deeds,
or make an donation.
<p>
    Though you're not supposed to say it, you can donate to the church in exchange for
    Revival Coins.

<h2>
    Guilds
</h2>
Guilds are organizations that specialize in finding work for their clients, while acting
as mediators to ensure that the both sides are treated fairly. <br>
Symbolically, guilds are a hub of civilization and good-will towards those who often
spend time away from home. For members, aside from just a source of income, they provide lodging, food, and other means
of support.
<p>
    If you're going to a guild for help, you would first create a job listing. The job
    listing describes the task that needs done. Next, the job listing is given
    to the clerk, who reviews the job, sets a difficulty rank, a price, and how many members are required to complete
    it.<br>
    From there, it is posted to the job board for guild members to browse and consider.
</p>
<p>
    When a guild member or party of guild members find a job listing, they can claim it.
    Once claimed, the guild forbids anyone else to interfere with their labor until
    it is either completed or abandoned. Once the task is completed, the guild members
    return with the proof of their success and are then paid by the commissioner
    through the guild.
</p>
<p>
    Most guilds offer rewards of advancement and various privileges for a consistent
    track record of successful jobs. Typically, they look at your 10 most recent jobs,
    then assign you a rank based on the difficulty of the most jobs that you've completed.<br>
    Note: <i>If you've completed an equal amount of missions of differing ranks, then the bias is towards the most
    recently completed.</i>>
<div>
    For example. If you have recently completed 4 D-rank missions, 3 C-rank missions, 2 E-rank missions,
    and 1 A-Rank mission, then your guild rank is set to D, because out of the ten missions, you have more completed
    D-rank missions than the others. However, upon completing a C-rank mission, your guild-rank would increase to C.
</div>
</p>
<p>
    If you're able to complete a mission with fewer members than required, then the mission is counted
    as a rank higher than it normally would. In other words, if a mission is D-rank for 5 people, but two
    more capable members take care of it, then the rank is re-ranked as though it were originally meant
    for two people. The same goes for using more members than listed to complete a higher-ranked mission.
</p>
<p>
    If for some reason you're unable to complete your mission, you are allowed to drop it. Simply return
    to the guild and request to drop the quest. Dropping a quest for any reason will treat the quest as
    two failed quests on your report card, and may threaten your guild-ranking.
</p>
<p>
    Below is a table of mission ranks and their descriptions. They also include examples of missions
    that you'd typically see in an adventurer's guild, along with their typical pay ranges (not including the money
    you have acquired while completing it).

<h3>
    Treasure Hunter's Guild
</h3>
Out on the frontier you'll find the Treasure Hunter's Guild. This guild specializes in finding work
for people who make their living by delving into long-lost sites and recovering ancient artifacts. There
are guild branches all across the country, most often on the fringes of society where the known meets
the unknown. Collectors and curators often send their requests to the guilds in hopes to acquire
something new for their stores. Other times, treasure hunters do freelance work and sell their spoils
out on the open market.
    <p>In the Treasure Hunter's guild, a mission's difficulty is ranked similarly to one from the adventurer's
guild, with F-rank being the safest, and S-rank being the most dangerous. However, the grade of a treasure
        hunter is determined upon how often they acquire the item they're after.</p>

<h3>

The Adventurer's Guild is the archetypal fantasy guild and is likewise recognized across the land as a
