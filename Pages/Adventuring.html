    Adventuring
</h1>
<div class="Side" >
    A treasure hunter's life is one of danger and excitement. You'll be traveling
    the world in search of ancient wonders and hidden mysteries - things that
    bewilder and capture the imagination. Hoards of monsters, lethal traps, dungeon
    bosses, and so much more stand in your way. Yet, the dangers have their rewards:
    treasures of gold and jewels, magical items, powerful weapons, and world-altering
    revelations to secrets untold.<br>
    Yet, for a life so filled with excitement, everyone needs downtime. And so, in
    between escapades, treasure hunters can be found resting and preparing. The world
    is peppered with towns, cities, and various outposts. Find an inn, get a good sleep
    and have a nice meal; stop by the smith and upgrade your equipment, and maybe
    head out for some training.<br>
    It's all about balance.

    Civilization
</h1>
During your travels, you'll come across towns and cities where you can rest, relax,
and enjoy a quiet day. During your stay can do some shopping, learn the latest rumors,
and visit a guild for some extra work.
<h2 id="VillagesTownsCities">
    Villages, Towns, and Cities
</h2>
Throughout your adventures you'll come across various kinds of settlements. Each of these
settlements vary in size, economy, and offerings. The larger they are, the higher a
chance they have of possessing a service for something you're after.
<p>
    This table lists the ratings on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being least likely and 5 being most-likely.
    Additionally, 0 means that there is absolutely no chance of a presence, while 6 means that the service is offered in
    abundance.<br>
    A village is defined as a settlement with a relatively small population (1-500 people).<br>
    A town is defined as as settlement with an okay-sized population (500-1,500).<br>
    And a city is defined as a settlement with an large population (1,500+).

<h3>
    Heading into Civilization
</h3>
Your party consists of the player characters, along with any creatures or NPCs they may have befriended.
NPCs who are traveling with the party but aren't a part of the ground, are not considered members.
<p>
    In general, a create with standard sapience (human-like) are allowed in all settlements. However, all
    monsters and animals of lower-intelligence must wear a collar with their given name on it, if they're
    to be allowed to travel with you around town - otherwise they must be kept in a cell of some kind.
</p>
<p>
    When adventuring around human settlements, it is expected that you'll keep your weapons sheathed or
    hidden (depending on the laws), revealing them only to defend yourself in absolute necessary circumstances.
    Abilities, unless passive, are not allowed to be used in public, unless in cases of emergency,
    such as for healing a wound or defending against an attacker.
</p>
<p>
    Some settlements may tax you for entry. Once the tax is paid, you're free to come and go as you please
    for the remainder of the week.
</p>


<h2 id="RestAndRecovery">
    Rest and Recovery
</h2>
<p>
    As a general rule, just so long as you have some kind of bedroll, you can lay down
    for some rest. While resting, all your Health, Mana, Stamina, and Focus are restored,
    and you wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day ahead. However, there are
    different degrees of rest you can get.

<p>
    To make it clear - negative status effects that may have lasted from your most recent battle remain in effect.<br>
    In order to remove any negative status effects, go visit a doctor.
</p>
<h3>
    Good Rest
</h3>
Sleeping for eight hours in a warm, comfortable bed in a safe environment grants you the benefits of
a good rest.
<p>
    With a good rest, you gain a temporary +10% bonus to your maximum Vital scores. These
    last until they're lost, and cannot be restored through any means (even Battle Transience).<br>
    Upon awaking, you may also switch out your current abilities with ones from your sideboard.
</p>
<h3>
    Great Rest
</h3>
Better than a Good Rest, you must sleep in a luxurious room with a great bed
for eight or more hours to get the benefits of a Great Rest.
<p>
    With a Great Rest, you gain a temporary +20% bonus to your maximum Vital scores. This
    bonus cannot be restored through any means (even Battle Transience).<br>
    Upon awaking, you may also switch out your current abilities with ones from your sideboard.
</p>
<h3>
    Leveling Up
</h3>
<p>Now that you've rested for 3-6+ hours, you can finally level-up.<br>
    After you've finished your rest, if you've acquired enough experience points to meet or exceed the requirements,
    you can level-up. By doing so, you subtract the required amount from your current XP,
    and you follow the level-up process as described in <a href="LevelsAndProgression.html">Levels and
        Progression</a>.<br></p>
<b>Please note: If you have not rested, you cannot level-up.</b>
<h3>
    Doctor
</h3>
Just about every town has a doctor. These specialists are able to help restore you to
full health after a hard battle. Aside from restoring your vitals, they primarily
restore status conditions, such as poison, or disablement.
<p>
    Once in town, you can consult the doctor and pay a flat fee for their services.

    It only takes an hour to remedy any amount of afflictions.
</p>

<h3>
    Inns and Hotels
</h3>
Inns and hotels are establishments that provide rooms for overnight use. While resting
there, you gain the benefits of a good rest, along with other complimentary services
they might provide.
<p>
    Inns differ from hotels in that they are less formal and focus more on simple provisions.
</p>
<p>
    Hotels on the other hand, are focused on luxurious conditions and comfortable accommodations.
</p>
<p>
    In order to get the benefits of either establishment, you must spend the night there
    and get at least 8 hours of sleep.

<h3>
    The Church
</h3>
A JRPG just isn't complete without its vaguely-Catholic church. Just about every large
town has some kind of a church establishment where you can sit and reflect on your deeds,
or make an donation.
<p>
    Though you're not supposed to say it, you can donate to the church in exchange for
    Revival Coins.

<h2>
    Guilds
</h2>
Guilds are organizations that specialize in finding work for their clients, while acting
as mediators to ensure that the both sides are treated fairly. <br>
Symbolically, guilds are a hub of civilization and good-will towards those who often
spend time away from home. For members, aside from just a source of income, they provide lodging, food, and other means
of support.
<p>
    If you're going to a guild for help, you would first create a job listing. The job
    listing describes the task that needs done. Next, the job listing is given
    to the clerk, who reviews the job, sets a difficulty rank, time frame, a price, and how many members are required to
    complete
    it.<br>
    From there, it is posted to the job board for guild members to browse and consider.
</p>
<p>
    When a guild member or party of guild members find a job listing, they can claim it.
    Once claimed, the guild forbids anyone else to interfere with their labor until
    it is either completed or abandoned. Once the task is completed, the guild members
    return with the proof of their success and are then paid by the commissioner
    through the guild.
</p>
<p>
    Most guilds offer rewards of advancement and various privileges for a consistent
    track record of successful jobs. Typically, they look at your 10 most recent jobs,
    then assign you a rank based on the difficulty of the most jobs that you've completed.<br>
    Note: <i>If you've completed an equal amount of missions of differing ranks, then the bias is towards the most
    recently completed.</i>>
<div>
    For example. If you have recently completed 4 D-rank missions, 3 C-rank missions, 2 E-rank missions,
    and 1 A-Rank mission, then your guild rank is set to D, because out of the ten missions, you have more completed
    D-rank missions than the others. However, upon completing a C-rank mission, your guild-rank would increase to C.
</div>
</p>
<p>
    If you're able to complete a mission with fewer members than required, then the mission is counted
    as a rank higher than it normally would. In other words, if a mission is D-rank for 5 people, but two
    more capable members take care of it, then the rank is re-ranked as though it were originally meant
    for two people. The same goes for using more members than listed to complete a higher-ranked mission.
</p>
<p>
    If for some reason you're unable to complete your mission, you are allowed to drop it. Simply return
    to the guild and request to drop the quest. Dropping a quest for any reason will treat the quest as
    two failed quests on your report card, and may threaten your guild-ranking.
</p>
<p>
    Below is a table of mission ranks and their descriptions. They also include examples of missions
    that you'd typically see in an adventurer's guild, along with their typical pay ranges (not including the money
    you have acquired while completing it).

<h3>
    Treasure Hunter's Guild
</h3>
Out on the frontier you'll find the Treasure Hunter's Guild. This guild specializes in finding work
for people who make their living by delving into long-lost sites and recovering ancient artifacts. There
are guild branches all across the country, most often on the fringes of society where the known meets
the unknown. Collectors and curators often send their requests to the guilds in hopes to acquire
something new for their stores. Other times, treasure hunters do freelance work and sell their spoils
out on the open market.
<p>In the Treasure Hunter's guild, a mission's difficulty is ranked similarly to one from the adventurer's
    guild, with F-rank being the safest, and S-rank being the most dangerous. However, the grade of a treasure
    hunter is determined upon how often they acquire the item they're after.</p>

<h3>
    Adventurer's Guild
</h3>
The Adventurer's Guild is the archetypal fantasy guild and is likewise recognized across the land as a
hub for fantastic journeys into the unknown. Young and daring spirits have been attracted to its prospects
for centuries, and many have been challenged to grow - or be defeated - in order to survive.
<p>
    In reality, the Adventurer's Guild is more like a giant bulletin board from many other guilds; the
    guild itself only specializes in monster exterminations. Which means that, if you go to the guild in search
    of work, you'll find plenty of it - though most of the contracts will be through third-party guilds.
</p>
<p>
    This means, work from Treasure Hunter guilds, the Artisan Guilds, from Merchant guilds, and so on.
    Sometimes, a few black-market contracts*, veiled in coded languages, appear as well.
</p>
<sub>
    *Note: While it's not illegal to accept a black market contract, breaking the law is still illegal.
</sub>

<h3>
    Artisan's Guild
</h3>
This guild specializes in the proliferation of art and all related endeavors. It is a source of income
and advertisement for thousands of artists, aspiring and veteran, all across the world.
<p>
    They specialize in helping artists find work, as well as for transporting and protecting art. But most,
    artists will find work taking commissions from wealthier individuals, painting portraits or helping
    to compile poems.

</ul>
</p>
<p>
    For other treasure hunters, they can find work helping to recover lost pieces of art from across the world,
    such that they might be featured in museums.
</p>
<h3>
    Engineer's Guild
</h3>
This guild glorifies craftsmanship in all its various glories, from simple carpentry, all the way to
advances in science and technology. It is a guild built on the ideals of invention and innovation,
for making a better world through the practical application of science.
<p>
    Work found in the Engineer's Guild relates mostly to creating new devices, or collecting
    rare and exotic resources to bring back for the engineers. You'll also find work as an
    engineer in architecture and general repairs.
    <br>
    However, there is also a collection of legendary tasks, often commissioned by noblemen and rich
    merchants, for more philanthropic efforts. Such curing cancer, solving draught, and space travel.
</p>
<p>
    In recent years, the prestige of the guild has grown in thanks to the growing prevalence of technology
    in world. The need for better armor, better infrastructure, and smarter agriculture practices has
    lead to a sudden demand for experienced engineers. Such a demand has made the guild very wealthy.
</p>

<h3>
    Merchant Guild
</h3>
Dealing in all things related to production and its allocation, the Merchant Guild is the most prosperous
of all guilds, drawing work and workers from across the globe in mass. They function as a kind of
super-hub for buyers and sellers, establishing their vast markets in all major and minor cities, with
branches in most towns, and loaded wagons traveling to nearly all villages and smaller settlements.
<p>
    Work for the Merchant Guild is also the most various. Commissions range from boring and tedious,
    such as picking potatoes and moving pallets onto a ship, all the way to to deep-sea diving for shed
    leviathan shells. However, the average lies in simple shipping and handling.
</p>
<p>
    In reality, the real money for them is in stocks and bonds. Since all guild branches function
    as stock markets, with a small fee being collected from every trade, the Merchant Guild
    is more wealthy than most kings. This has lead to a contention between the Merchant Guild branches
    and the many rulers, often forcing the guild to enter special relations (read "bribery") in order
    to maintain their easy dealings.
</p>
<p>
    In conclusion, the Merchant Guild can be said to be as benevolent as it is malevolent. As in all things
    related to money, it leads to happiness as well as despair. When taking work for the Merchant Guild,
    be sure to chose wisely and read the fine print.
</p>

<h3>
    Magician's Guild
</h3>
Notably the oldest of all recognized guilds, they first started out as interconnected cults fascinated
with the arcane arts, and eventually grew to public acceptance. As magic became more necessary
to the establishment of major civilizations, the power of the Magician's Guild grew with it. For a long time,
guild halls functions as schools, lecture halls, and private markets for the trade of rare and strange
relics. Today, though their social prominence is waning, they are still the foremost commissioners
of magicians in the world.
<p>
    Work for the Magician's Guild tends to be the most dangerous, purely for the for that you'll
    be dealing with magical items. Work ranges from the simple collection of artifacts, all the way
    to helping with the creation of the Sorcerer's Stone - which tends to end in tragedy every time.
</p>
<p>
    Guild branches themselves tend be curious places, often older than the towns they're in, and piled
    high wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling with books, scrolls, tablets, manuscripts, and little boxes labeled
    in script that can no longer be read. Curiosity here is more certain to kill you than
    out on the field.
</p>

<h3>
    Freelancers
</h3>
Though guilds abound in the world, not everyone is in a guild. In fact, there are quite a few fellows out there
who prefer to do business on their own terms. Typically called Freelances, they roam from town to town
looking for work, advertising themselves at lower prices than the guilds do, often coming out with
more money than a guild member would also. However, without a guild to represent and back them up in case of conflict,
there's a higher degree of risk to it.
<p>
    You can typically find advertisements for Freelancers on town bulletin boards or in the public places. Freelancers
    come in as many flavors as the guilds do; where there's an adventurer's guild, there are plenty of Freelancer
    adventurers,
    and so on. To start negotiations, all one has to do is approach them with a task and an initial offer of
    compensation.
    From there, an agreement is reached and the Freelancer goes to work.
</p>
<p>
    On average, Freelancers are 20-30% more affordable than guildmembers, since there's
    typically no guildfees or taxes that apply to your agreements. However, without an intermediate
    party to ensure that that both parties can be protected in case of tragedy, this can make trusting
    Freelancers difficult. If you become a Freelancer, most of the work will come from maintaining a
    good name for yourself.
</p>

<h3>
    Black Markets
</h3>
Where there is a law, there is market for breaking it. Across the world, whenever a good or a service
is banned or too tightly-regulated, its consumption merely moved into the dangerous and uncertain world
of the black market. These markets exist in the shadows, often curated by the wealthy and the powerful.
<p>
    The black market is more dangerous than the Adventurer's Guild and more lucrative than the Merchant's
    Guild, which is why both guilds tend to be so close - yet so far - to the action. In reality, there is
    no physical market, but a web of connections between buyers and sellers. One person knows another
    who knows another who knows of a fellow who happens to be selling illegal thing X, and arrangements
    can be made for a trade - but only if you are trusted.
</p>
<p>
    Indeed, dealing with the black market is dangerous. Either it goes right, or you end up swindles,
    betrayed, or in jail. And the more money there is to be made, the bigger the risk. Yet, despite
    all the frustrations by the police, the market persists.
</p>

<h3>
    Auctions
</h3>
<p>
    Practiced by most guilds, the auction house exists as a special event for the acquisition of expensive
    unique goods. This is done by gathering with other bidders and placing bids on the presented
    article. This can be a good, such as furniture or a land deed, or even a service such as having
    your roof repaired or a portrait painted.
</p>
<p>
    The goal of the auction is to get a low-supply/high-demand good or service to the person who is
    willing to pay for the most.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, an item is first place for auction with a starting bid, and bidders can take turns
    out-bidding their competitors. When the bid slows to a halt, the person who most recently bid
    is declared the victor. Behind curtains, the exchange is made.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>
    NPC Services
</h2>
In every settlement, there is certain to be at least one person, specialized in a trade,
who is willing to sell their services. There can be carpenters, stone masons, artists, smiths, weapon
manufacturers, and all sorts of things that a party might need.
<p>
    In game, the DM is in charge of determining how these services are rendered. However, there are special,
    more technical services out there that player characters are certain to need. Below is a list
    of various NPC services for the players.
</p>
<h3>
    Training
</h3>
Players aren't always as strong or talented as they want to be can spend their free time on mastering
their abilities in a low-risk environment. This can be done by paying a fee to use a specialized training area,
or for free by heading out into the wilderness.
<p>
    There are two kinds of training: level-grinding, and studying.
<ul>
    <li>
        Level-grinding is done by fighting in a controlled environment to steadily gain more
        levels. The higher your current level, the more time is required to increase it - this is because
        finding powerful monsters are scarcer than weaker ones.<br>
        It is not possible to grind after level 15.
    </li>
    <li>
        Studying is done by going to a studio that relates to the talent you wish to improve
        and devoting your time to practice and understanding.
    </li>
</ul>
Both of these methods require plenty of time - which may not be feasible of you're short of time. Keep in mind,
just because you're not doing anything, doesn't mean your adversaries aren't doing anything either.
</p>

<p>
    Both of these can be done for free, in which you go out into the wilderness, or paid, in which you
    spend money to use a specialized area. Paid training yields results faster, but you may not
    have the money to afford it.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Level Grinding</b><br>
    Done by going out and fighting weaker runts and mobs of the same level.
    This is done a day at a time, in which you must be able to devote 12 hours at once to the task.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of each day, a 1d20 is rolled for the whole party to see how much each participant gained.
    The higher they roll, the better.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>1-9: 300xp</li>
    <li>10-15: 450xp</li>
    <li>16-19: 600xp</li>
    <li>20: 900xp</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Alternatively, you can pay [500 x Player Level]gil a day to use a specialized training area.<br>
    Using a training area increase earned XP by 2x. Though rare, more specialized training areas exist,
    which further multiply your earned XP.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>Studying</b><br>
    Find a safe, quiet place to set down and hone one of your talents. The amount of time
    it takes to improve a talent by 1 point is determined by its current score.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        -1 and below: 3 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        0-1: 6 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        2-4: 12 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        5-9: 24 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        10: Indefinite.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The equivalent of a training area, is a book. Studying with a book
    reduced the amount of hours (minimum 1) to earn your next point.
    However, the book, having been read, cannot be benefited (for fewer hours) from again.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Introductory book: -1 hour.
    </li>
    <li>
        Student book: -3 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        Journeyman book: -6 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        Master book: -12 hours.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>
    Buying and Selling Goods
</h3>
In just about every settlement there are going to be stores
where you can buy goods from. General stores tend to sell tools and (most) moderately
priced consumables. However, more expensive items (500gil and higher) tend to be found in
specialty stores.<br>
<p>
    When you're in a general store, you'll be able to consult the clerk and purchase
    from a variety of simple goods. Pick what you want, pay the gil - simple stuff.
</p>
<p>
    Keep in mind that, generally speaking, Tools weigh about 5u, and Consumables
    weight about 0.2u.
</p>
<p>
    Not all stores will be able to buy goods from you. Some merchants aren't in the market for your
    wears, and others may not have the gil on hand to buy it with. Merchants that can and want to buy your wears
    will buy your wears at half their listed price.
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively, if an NPC likes or dislikes you, then they'll make you an offer that better reflects
    that disposition.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Dislike. Sell to you at 150% marked price; buy from you at 25% market price.
    </li>
    <li>
        Indifferent. Sell to you at 100% marked price; buy from you at 50% market price.
    </li>
    <li>
        Like. Sell to you at 50% marked price; buy from you at 75% market price.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    By default, NPC's are indifferent to you. However, if you do something they like or dislike, then they'll come
    to change their attitude. Typically, you can perform a task for them, such as giving them an item they're after
    to earn their favor.
</p>
<h3>
    Upgrading Weapons
</h3>
Upgrading your weapons can be costly, since weapon parts do not come cheap, and neither
do weapon smiths, but if you have resources, you can enhance your weapon with new
attributes to make it more effective.
<p>
    If you have a <a href="Equipment.html#WeaponPart">weapon part</a>, you can
    give it to a weapon smith, who, for the service fee, will use it to improve
    your weapon. This process takes 8 hours, during which you won't have that weapon.
</p>
<p>
    You get to choose what the upgrade is by either picking a new Attribute from
    the <a href="Equipment.html#WeaponAttributes">weapon attributes</a> section,
    or by improving an existing attribute's score (X) by +1.<br>
    <sub>As a note: You cannot increase an attribute's score by more than 5.</sub>
</p>
<p>
    After the 8 hours have passed, you're free to return to the smith and pick up your weapon.
    Note, that the weapon's weight has not changed, despite technically containing a weapon piece inside of
    it.
</p>

<h3>
    Talent Services
</h3>
In every town you go to, you'll be certain to find talented individuals who are willing to sell you their
services. These are simple jobs that people typically take up as a trade, such as forest guide, smith,
linguist, and detective.
<p>
    In gameplay, you'll seek out talent services when you have task that requires a high score in a talent
    and no one in the party is good enough. You'll go to the town, search out someone with proficiency
    in that talent, and attempt to hire them for their talent.
</p>
<p>
    Talents are more affordable than Freelancers and guildsmen, but lack the versatility or the implied combat
    prowess that the other have; they're just townsfolk, after all. If you want to take them along on an adventure,
    treat them as Civilians (See Monster Guide).
</p>
<p>
    Talents can be hired by the day or per-check, depending on their needs and yours. Making a
    contract with one is similar in how you'd strike one up with another. Below is a list of typical
    asking prices per day, along with prices as their skills increase.

<h1>
    Dungeons
</h1>
Dungeons are dangerous places, often remote from society and filled with dangers. Yet, for all the dangers they
pose, they are likewise filled with treasures that only the most capable of acquiring. As the saying goes,
there is no risk without reward.
<p>
    While dungeons exist in the traditional term, Dewprism Tactics uses dungeon to mean any formal area meant
    for combat, exploration, and treasure acquisition. They can come in any size
    and difficulty. This means that forests, caves, castles, and even churches
    can all technically dungeons.
</p>
<p>
    On a more formulaic note, it is assumed that dungeons will possess multiple floors, mini-boss fights,
    boss fights, traps, and loot. However, in the spirit of roleplaying games, please be assured that
    these are just guidelines aren't actually enforceable.
</p>
<p>
    This section will explain the in's and out's of dungeons, how to build them, how to populate them,
    how to grade them, and how to run them.
</p>
<h2>
    Design
</h2>
    When designing your dungeon, the first thing you should do is conceptualize it: what is the dungeon's theme,
    what is its purpose (narrative- and lore-wise), how difficult will it be, how long will it take to complete,
    and rewards will it offer? The goal is have a complete understanding of the dungeon, so that way you're
in complete control of it.
<p>
    First starting with the concept, you should think about what the dungeon itself is about - what is the thing
    that makes it unique from all the other dungeons in your campaign? This could be a particular element,
    like water or fire, or maybe something that inspired a mood, like curiosity or dread. Also think
    about unique mechanisms you might need to work with in order to explore it. Maybe your dungeon
    uses portals that must be activated in order to navigate, or or maybe the dungeon demands
    that you light four ghostly torches to reveal the boss's lair?
</p>
<p>
    Next, you should consider how difficult it will be. If this is a story-driven game, in that you have the
    absolute certainty that the players will be taking up this dungeon next, then you should plan for it
    to be appropriate for their level. All the monsters in the dungeon should be of equal level with the player
    characters, and the traps should all deal appropriate damage for the dungeon's level.
