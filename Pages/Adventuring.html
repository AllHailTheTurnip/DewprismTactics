            A treasure hunter's life is one of danger and excitement. You'll be
            traveling
            the world in search of ancient wonders and hidden mysteries - things
            that
            bewilder and capture the imagination. Hoards of monsters, lethal
            traps, dungeon
            bosses, and so much more stand in your way. Yet, the dangers have
            their rewards:
            treasures of gold and jewels, magical items, powerful weapons, and
            world-altering
            revelations to secrets untold.<br>
            Yet, for a life so filled with excitement, everyone needs downtime.
            And so, in
            between escapades, treasure hunters can be found resting and
            preparing. The world
            is peppered with towns, cities, and various outposts. Find an inn,
            get a good sleep
            and have a nice meal; stop by the smith and upgrade your equipment,
            and maybe
            head out for some training.<br>
            It's all about balance.

        During your travels, you'll come across towns and cities where you can
        rest, relax,
        and enjoy a quiet day. During your stay can do some shopping, learn the
        latest rumors,
        and visit a guild for some extra work.

            Villages, Towns, and Cities
        </h2>
        Throughout your adventures you'll come across various kinds of
        settlements. Each of these
        settlements vary in size, economy, and offerings. The larger they are,
        the higher a
        chance they have of possessing a service for something you're after.
        <p>
            This table lists the ratings on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being
            least likely and 5 being most-likely.
            Additionally, 0 means that there is absolutely no chance of a
            presence, while 6 means that the service is offered in
            abundance.<br>
            A village is defined as a settlement with a relatively small
            population (1-500 people).<br>
            A town is defined as settlement with an okay-sized population
            (500-1,500).<br>
            And a city is defined as a settlement with an large population
            (1,500+).

        <h3>
            Heading into Civilization
        </h3>
        Your party consists of the player characters, along with any creatures
        or NPCs they may have befriended.
        NPCs who are traveling with the party but aren't a part of the ground,
        are not considered members.
        <p>
            In general, a creature with standard sapience (human-like) are allowed
            in all settlements. However, all
            monsters and animals of lower-intelligence must wear a collar with
            their given name on it, if they're
            to be allowed to travel with you around town - otherwise they must
            be kept in a cell of some kind.
        </p>
        <p>
            When adventuring around human settlements, it is expected that
            you'll keep your weapons sheathed or
            hidden (depending on the laws), revealing them only to defend
            yourself in absolute necessary circumstances.
            Abilities, unless passive, are not allowed to be used in public,
            unless in cases of emergency,
            such as for healing a wound or defending against an attacker.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some settlements may tax you for entry. Once the tax is paid, you're
            free to come and go as you please
            for the remainder of the week.
        </p>

            Rest and Recovery

        <p>
            As a general rule, just so long as you have some kind of bedroll,
            you can lay down
            for some rest. While resting, all your Health, Stamina, Mana, and
            Focus are restored,
            and you wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day ahead.
            However, there are
            different degrees of rest you can get.

            Good Rest
        </h3>
        Sleeping for eight hours in a warm, comfortable bed in a safe
        environment grants you the benefits of
        a good rest.
        <p>
            With a good rest, you gain a temporary +10% bonus to your maximum
            Vital scores. These
            last until they're lost, and cannot be restored through any means
            (even Battle Transience).<br>
            Upon awaking, you may also switch out your current abilities with
            ones from your sideboard.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Great Rest
        </h3>
        Better than a Good Rest, you must sleep in a luxurious room with a great
        bed
        for eight or more hours to get the benefits of a Great Rest.
        <p>
            With a Great Rest, you gain a temporary +20% bonus to your maximum
            Vital scores. This
            bonus cannot be restored through any means (even Battle Transience).<br>
            Upon awaking, you may also switch out your current abilities with

        <h3>
            Leveling Up
        </h3>
        <p>Now that you've rested for 3-6+ hours, you can finally level-up.<br>
            After you've finished your rest, if you've acquired enough
            experience points to meet or exceed the requirements,
            you can level-up. By doing so, you subtract the required amount from
            your current XP,
            and you follow the level-up process as described in <a
                    href="LevelsAndProgression.html">Levels and

        Just about every town has a doctor. These specialists are able to help
        restore you to
        full health after a hard battle. Aside from restoring your vitals, they
        primarily
        restore status conditions, such as poison, or disablement.
        <p>
            Once in town, you can consult the doctor and pay a flat fee for
            their services.

            Inns and Hotels
        </h3>
        Inns and hotels are establishments that provide rooms for overnight use.
        While resting
        there, you gain the benefits of a good rest, along with other
        complimentary services
        they might provide.
        <p>
            Inns differ from hotels in that they are less formal and focus more
            on simple provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hotels on the other hand, are focused on luxurious conditions and
            comfortable accommodations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to get the benefits of either establishment, you must spend
            the night there
            and get at least 8 hours of sleep.

        <h2 id="Guilds">
            Guilds
        </h2>
        Guilds are organizations that specialize in finding work for their
        clients, while acting
        as mediators to ensure that the both sides are treated fairly. <br>
        Symbolically, guilds are a hub of civilization and good-will towards
        those who often
        spend time away from home. For members, aside from just a source of
        income, they provide lodging, food, and other means
        of support.
        <p>
            If you're going to a guild for help, you would first create a job
            listing. The job
            listing describes the task that needs done. Next, the job listing is
            given
            to the clerk, who reviews the job, sets a difficulty rank, time
            frame, a price, and how many members are required to
            complete
            it.<br>
            From there, it is posted to the job board for guild members to
            browse and consider.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a guild member or party of guild members find a job listing,
            they can claim it.
            Once claimed, the guild forbids anyone else to interfere with their
            labor until
            it is either completed or abandoned. Once the task is completed, the
            guild members
            return with the proof of their success and are then paid by the
            commissioner
            through the guild.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most guilds offer rewards of advancement and various privileges for
            a consistent
            track record of successful jobs. Typically, they look at your 10
            most recent jobs,
            then assign you a rank based on the difficulty of the most jobs that
            you've completed.<br>
            Note: <i>If you've completed an equal amount of missions of
            differing ranks, then the bias is towards the most
            recently completed.</i>>
        <div>
            For example. If you have recently completed 4 D-rank missions, 3
            C-rank missions, 2 E-rank missions,
            and 1 A-Rank mission, then your guild rank is set to D, because out
            of the ten missions, you have more completed
            D-rank missions than the others. However, upon completing a C-rank
            mission, your guild-rank would increase to C.
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're able to complete a mission with fewer members than
            required, then the mission is counted
            as a rank higher than it normally would. In other words, if a
            mission is D-rank for 5 people, but two
            more capable members take care of it, then the rank is re-ranked as
            though it were originally meant
            for two people. The same goes for using more members than listed to
            complete a higher-ranked mission.
        </p>
        <p>
            If for some reason you're unable to complete your mission, you are
            allowed to drop it. Simply return
            to the guild and request to drop the quest. Dropping a quest for any
            reason will treat the quest as
            two failed quests on your report card, and may threaten your
            guild-ranking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a table of mission ranks and their descriptions. They also
            include examples of missions
            that you'd typically see in an adventurer's guild, along with their
            typical pay ranges (not including the money
            you have acquired while completing it).

        <h3>
            Treasure Hunter's Guild
        </h3>
        Out on the frontier you'll find the Treasure Hunter's Guild. This guild
        specializes in finding work
        for people who make their living by delving into long-lost sites and
        recovering ancient artifacts. There
        are guild branches all across the country, most often on the fringes of
        society where the known meets
        the unknown. Collectors and curators often send their requests to the
        guilds in hopes to acquire
        something new for their stores. Other times, treasure hunters do
        freelance work and sell their spoils
        out on the open market.
        <p>In the Treasure Hunter's guild, a mission's difficulty is ranked
            similarly to one from the adventurer's
            guild, with F-rank being the safest, and S-rank being the most
            dangerous. However, the grade of a treasure
            hunter is determined upon how often they acquire the item they're
            after.</p>

        <h3>
            Adventurer's Guild
        </h3>
        The Adventurer's Guild is the archetypal fantasy guild and is likewise
        recognized across the land as a
        hub for fantastic journeys into the unknown. Young and daring spirits
        have been attracted to its prospects
        for centuries, and many have been challenged to grow - or be defeated -
        in order to survive.
        <p>
            In reality, the Adventurer's Guild is more like a giant bulletin
            board from many other guilds; the
            guild itself only specializes in monster exterminations. Which means
            that, if you go to the guild in search
            of work, you'll find plenty of it - though most of the contracts
            will be through third-party guilds.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means, work from Treasure Hunter guilds, the Artisan Guilds,
            from Merchant guilds, and so on.
            Sometimes, a few black-market contracts*, veiled in coded languages,
            appear as well.
        </p>
        <sub>
            *Note: While it's not illegal to accept a black market contract,
            breaking the law is still illegal.

        <h3>
            Artisan's Guild
        </h3>
        This guild specializes in the proliferation of art and all related
        endeavors. It is a source of income
        and advertisement for thousands of artists, aspiring and veteran, all
        across the world.
        <p>
            They specialize in helping artists find work, as well as for
            transporting and protecting art. But most,
            artists will find work taking commissions from wealthier
            individuals, painting portraits or helping
            to compile poems.

            Engineer's Guild
        </h3>
        This guild glorifies craftsmanship in all its various glories, from
        simple carpentry, all the way to
        advances in science and technology. It is a guild built on the ideals of
        invention and innovation,
        for making a better world through the practical application of science.
        <p>
            Work found in the Engineer's Guild relates mostly to creating new
            devices, or collecting
            rare and exotic resources to bring back for the engineers. You'll
            also find work as an
            engineer in architecture and general repairs.
            <br>
            However, there is also a collection of legendary tasks, often
            commissioned by noblemen and rich
            merchants, for more philanthropic efforts. Such curing cancer,
            solving draught, and space travel.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent years, the prestige of the guild has grown in thanks to
            the growing prevalence of technology
            in world. The need for better armor, better infrastructure, and
            smarter agriculture practices has
            lead to a sudden demand for experienced engineers. Such a demand has
            made the guild very wealthy.

        <h3>
            Merchant Guild
        </h3>
        Dealing in all things related to production and its allocation, the
        Merchant Guild is the most prosperous
        of all guilds, drawing work and workers from across the globe in mass.
        They function as a kind of
        super-hub for buyers and sellers, establishing their vast markets in all
        major and minor cities, with
        branches in most towns, and loaded wagons traveling to nearly all
        villages and smaller settlements.
        <p>
            Work for the Merchant Guild is also the most various. Commissions
            range from boring and tedious,
            such as picking potatoes and moving pallets onto a ship, all the way
            to to deep-sea diving for shed
            leviathan shells. However, the average lies in simple shipping and
            handling.
        </p>
        <p>
            In reality, the real money for them is in stocks and bonds. Since
            all guild branches function
            as stock markets, with a small fee being collected from every trade,
            the Merchant Guild
            is more wealthy than most kings. This has lead to a contention
            between the Merchant Guild branches
            and the many rulers, often forcing the guild to enter special
            relations (read "bribery") in order
            to maintain their easy dealings.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, the Merchant Guild can be said to be as benevolent as
            it is malevolent. As in all things
            related to money, it leads to happiness as well as despair. When
            taking work for the Merchant Guild,
            be sure to chose wisely and read the fine print.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Magician's Guild
        </h3>
        Notably the oldest of all recognized guilds, they first started out as
        interconnected cults fascinated
        with the arcane arts, and eventually grew to public acceptance. As magic
        became more necessary
        to the establishment of major civilizations, the power of the Magician's
        Guild grew with it. For a long time,
        guild halls functions as schools, lecture halls, and private markets for
        the trade of rare and strange
        relics. Today, though their social prominence is waning, they are still
        the foremost commissioners
        of magicians in the world.
        <p>
            Work for the Magician's Guild tends to be the most dangerous, purely
            for the for that you'll
            be dealing with magical items. Work ranges from the simple
            collection of artifacts, all the way
            to helping with the creation of the Sorcerer's Stone - which tends
            to end in tragedy every time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Guild branches themselves tend be curious places, often older than
            the towns they're in, and piled
            high wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling with books, scrolls, tablets,
            manuscripts, and little boxes labeled
            in script that can no longer be read. Curiosity here is more certain
            to kill you than
            out on the field.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Freelancers
        </h3>
        Though guilds abound in the world, not everyone is in a guild. In fact,
        there are quite a few fellows out there
        who prefer to do business on their own terms. Typically called
        Freelances, they roam from town to town
        looking for work, advertising themselves at lower prices than the guilds
        do, often coming out with
        more money than a guild member would also. However, without a guild to
        represent and back them up in case of conflict,
        there's a higher degree of risk to it.
        <p>
            You can typically find advertisements for Freelancers on town
            bulletin boards or in the public places. Freelancers
            come in as many flavors as the guilds do; where there's an
            adventurer's guild, there are plenty of Freelancer
            adventurers,
            and so on. To start negotiations, all one has to do is approach them
            with a task and an initial offer of
            compensation.
            From there, an agreement is reached and the Freelancer goes to work.
        </p>
        <p>
            On average, Freelancers are 20-30% more affordable than
            guildmembers, since there's
            typically no guildfees or taxes that apply to your agreements.
            However, without an intermediate
            party to ensure that that both parties can be protected in case of
            tragedy, this can make trusting
            Freelancers difficult. If you become a Freelancer, most of the work
            will come from maintaining a
            good name for yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Black Markets
        </h3>
        Where there is a law, there is market for breaking it. Across the world,
        whenever a good or a service
        is banned or too tightly-regulated, its consumption merely moved into
        the dangerous and uncertain world
        of the black market. These markets exist in the shadows, often curated
        by the wealthy and the powerful.
        <p>
            The black market is more dangerous than the Adventurer's Guild and
            more lucrative than the Merchant's
            Guild, which is why both guilds tend to be so close - yet so far -
            to the action. In reality, there is
            no physical market, but a web of connections between buyers and
            sellers. One person knows another
            who knows another who knows of a fellow who happens to be selling
            illegal thing X, and arrangements
            can be made for a trade - but only if you are trusted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Indeed, dealing with the black market is dangerous. Either it goes
            right, or you end up swindles,
            betrayed, or in jail. And the more money there is to be made, the
            bigger the risk. Yet, despite
            all the frustrations by the police, the market persists.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Auctions
        </h3>
        <p>
            Practiced by most guilds, the auction house exists as a special
            event for the acquisition of expensive
            unique goods. This is done by gathering with other bidders and
            placing bids on the presented
            article. This can be a good, such as furniture or a land deed, or
            even a service such as having
            your roof repaired or a portrait painted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of the auction is to get a low-supply/high-demand good or
            service to the person who is
            willing to pay for the most.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, an item is first place for auction with a starting bid,
            and bidders can take turns
            out-bidding their competitors. When the bid slows to a halt, the
            person who most recently bid
            is declared the victor. Behind curtains, the exchange is made.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="Services">
            NPC Services
        </h2>
        In every settlement, there is certain to be at least one person,
        specialized in a trade,
        who is willing to sell their services. There can be carpenters, stone
        masons, artists, smiths, weapon
        manufacturers, and all sorts of things that a party might need.
        <p>
            In game, the DM is in charge of determining how these services are
            rendered. However, there are special,
            more technical services out there that player characters are certain
            to need. Below is a list
            of various NPC services for the players.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Training
        </h3>
        Players aren't always as strong or talented as they want to be can spend
        their free time on mastering
        their abilities in a low-risk environment. This can be done by paying a
        fee to use a specialized training area,
        or for free by heading out into the wilderness.
        <p>
            There are two kinds of training: level-grinding, and studying.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Level-grinding is done by fighting in a controlled environment
                to steadily gain more
                levels. The higher your current level, the more time is required
                to increase it - this is because
                finding powerful monsters are scarcer than weaker ones.<br>
                It is not possible to grind after level 15.
            </li>
            <li>
                Studying is done by going to a studio that relates to the talent
                you wish to improve
                and devoting your time to practice and understanding.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Both of these methods require plenty of time - which may not be feasible
        of you're short of time. Keep in mind,
        just because you're not doing anything, doesn't mean your adversaries
        aren't doing anything either.
        </p>

        <p>
            Both of these can be done for free, in which you go out into the
            wilderness, or paid, in which you
            spend money to use a specialized area. Paid training yields results
            faster, but you may not
            have the money to afford it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Level Grinding</b><br>
            Done by going out and fighting weaker runts and mobs of the same
            level.
            This is done a day at a time, in which you must be able to devote 12
            hours at once to the task.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of each day, a 1d20 is rolled for the whole party to see
            how much each participant gained.
            The higher they roll, the better.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1-9: 300xp</li>
            <li>10-15: 450xp</li>
            <li>16-19: 600xp</li>
            <li>20: 900xp</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Alternatively, you can pay [500 x Player Level]gil a day to use a
            specialized training area.<br>
            Using a training area increase earned XP by 2x. Though rare, more
            specialized training areas exist,
            which further multiply your earned XP.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Studying</b><br>
            Find a safe, quiet place to set down and hone one of your talents.
            The amount of time
            it takes to improve a talent by 1 point is determined by its current
            score.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                -1 and below: 3 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                0-1: 6 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                2-4: 12 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                5-9: 24 hours.

                10: Indefinite.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The equivalent of a training area, is a book. Studying with a book
            reduced the amount of hours (minimum 1) to earn your next point.
            However, the book, having been read, cannot be benefited (for fewer
            hours) from again.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Introductory book: -1 hour.

            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>
            Buying and Selling Goods
        </h3>
        In just about every settlement there are going to be stores
        where you can buy goods from. General stores tend to sell tools and
        (most) moderately
        priced consumables. However, more expensive items (500gil and higher)
        tend to be found in
        specialty stores.<br>
        <p>
            When you're in a general store, you'll be able to consult the clerk
            and purchase
            from a variety of simple goods. Pick what you want, pay the gil -
            simple stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind that, generally speaking, Tools weigh about 5u, and
            Consumables
            weight about 0.2u.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all stores will be able to buy goods from you. Some merchants
            aren't in the market for your
            wears, and others may not have the gil on hand to buy it with.
            Merchants that can and want to buy your wears
            will buy your wears at half their listed price.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, if an NPC likes or dislikes you, then they'll make
            you an offer that better reflects
            that disposition.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Dislike. Sell to you at 150% marked price; buy from you at 25%
                market price.
            </li>
            <li>
                Indifferent. Sell to you at 100% marked price; buy from you at
                50% market price.
            </li>
            <li>
                Like. Sell to you at 50% marked price; buy from you at 75%
                market price.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By default, NPC's are indifferent to you. However, if you do
            something they like or dislike, then they'll come
            to change their attitude. Typically, you can perform a task for
            them, such as giving them an item they're after
            to earn their favor.
        </p>
        <h3>Buying and Selling Materials</h3>
        You can purchase Materials from General Stores. However, their
        starting price will be 10x higher than listed in
        <a href="Craftables.html">Craftables.</a>
        This is because the prices listed are for their initial sale.
        These materials, especially the more expensive ones,
        are difficult to come by and so the merchants are certain to
        increase their price to reflect that.
        <p>
            Likewise, other craftables can be purchased at 10x their marked
            price, and sold for their exact marked price. However,
            priced are still subject to change based on the merchant's
            disposition toward you.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Upgrading Weapons
        </h3>
        Upgrading your weapons can be costly, since weapon parts do not come
        cheap, and neither
        do weapon smiths, but if you have resources, you can enhance your weapon
        with new
        attributes to make it more effective.
        <p>
            If you have a <a href="Equipment.html#WeaponPart">weapon part</a>,
            you can
            give it to a weapon smith, who, for the service fee, will use it to
            improve
            your weapon. This process takes 8 hours, during which you won't have
            that weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
            You get to choose what the upgrade is by either picking a new
            Attribute from
            the <a href="Equipment.html#WeaponAttributes">weapon attributes</a>
            section,
            or by improving an existing attribute's score (X) by +1.<br>
            <sub>As a note: You cannot increase an attribute's score by more
                than 5.</sub>
        </p>
        <p>
            After the 8 hours have passed, you're free to return to the smith
            and pick up your weapon.
            Note, that the weapon's weight has not changed, despite technically
            containing a weapon piece inside of
            it.

            Talent Services
        </h3>
        In every town you go to, you'll be certain to find talented individuals
        who are willing to sell you their
        services. These are simple jobs that people typically take up as a
        trade, such as forest guide, smith,
        linguist, and detective.
        <p>
            In gameplay, you'll seek out talent services when you have task that
            requires a high score in a talent
            and no one in the party is good enough. You'll go to the town,
            search out someone with proficiency
            in that talent, and attempt to hire them for their talent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Talents are more affordable than Freelancers and guildsmen, but lack
            the versatility or the implied combat
            prowess that the other have; they're just townsfolk, after all. If
            you want to take them along on an adventure,
            treat them as Civilians (See Monster Guide).
        </p>
        <p>
            Talents can be hired by the day or per-check, depending on their
            needs and yours. Making a
            contract with one is similar in how you'd strike one up with
            another. Below is a list of typical
            asking prices per day, along with prices as their skills increase.

            Dungeons
        </h1>
        Dungeons are dangerous places, often remote from society and filled with
        dangers. Yet, for all the dangers they
        pose, they are likewise filled with treasures that only the most capable
        can acquire. As the saying goes, there is no risk without reward.
        <p>
            While dungeons exist in the traditional term, Dewprism Tactics uses
            dungeon to mean any formal area meant
            for combat, exploration, and treasure acquisition. They can come in
            any size
            and difficulty. This means that forests, caves, castles, and even
            churches
            can all technically be dungeons.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a more formulaic note, it is assumed that dungeons will possess
            multiple floors, mini-boss fights,
            boss fights, traps, and loot. However, in the spirit of roleplaying
            games, please be assured that
            these are just guidelines aren't actually enforceable.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section will explain the in's and out's of dungeons, how to
            build them, how to populate them,
            how to grade them, and how to run them.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Design">
            Design
        </h2>
        When designing your dungeon, the first thing you should do is
        conceptualize it: what is the dungeon's theme,
        what is its purpose (narrative- and lore-wise), how difficult will it
        be, how long will it take to complete,
        and rewards will it offer? The goal is have a complete understanding of
        the dungeon, so that way you're
        in complete control of it.
        <p>
            First starting with the concept, you should think about what the
            dungeon itself is about - what is the thing
            that makes it unique from all the other dungeons in your campaign?
            This could be a particular element,
            like water or fire, or maybe something that inspired a mood, like
            curiosity or dread. Also think
            about unique mechanisms you might need to work with in order to
            explore it. Maybe your dungeon
            uses portals that must be activated in order to navigate, or or
            maybe the dungeon demands
            that you light four ghostly torches to reveal the boss's lair?
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, you should consider how difficult it will be. If this is a
            story-driven game, in that you have the
            absolute certainty that the players will be taking up this dungeon
            next, then you should plan for it
            to be appropriate for their level. All the monsters in the dungeon
            should be of equal level with the player
            characters, and the traps should all deal appropriate damage for the
            dungeon's level.
        </p>
        <p>
            A good place to start is with the chart below. Though not the absolute rule, it's a good place
            to start when fleshing out your dungeon.<br/>
            Keep mind that the dungeons are scaled assuming that your party consists of four people. Elements
            that should be adjusted proportionately to match your party's size will be marked with an asterisk.

            Dungeons tend to have a difficulty-curve to them. This helps the players dip their toe into
            the adventure without the risk of losing their leg. Normally, the flow should go as such:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Starting</b>: An easy, introductory fight or challenge that teaches players about the theming and
                general challenge of the dungeon's horrors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Middle</b>: A slighter harder conflict that ramps up the tension, pushing the players to test their
                solutions. This is usually where the miniboss first appears.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>End</b>: Near the end of the dungeon there should be no more bars held; all that the players
                have learned will now be put to test against them in full force.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="Battlefields">
            Battlefields
        </h2>
        <p>Battlefields are an essential part of each dungeon. Put simply, battlefields are areas
        designated by the DM (you) for combat. There will typically be enemy combatants waiting for the party
        to arrive so that combat can officially begin.</p>
        <p>
            As the DM, you should design battlefields first around flow and then around function. When it
            comes to it, a battlefield is simply a web of spots that players must navigate before getting
            within range against their opponents. Movement has a lot to do with it, and between finding cover,
            avoiding hazard, and controlling range, combatants should feel the need to position themselves properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a math to the design of dungeons, however. Each one should follow certain dimensions (in spaces),
            and should offer a proper amount of cover places and (possibly) traps.

        <p>Most battlefields aren't flat. In fact, some can be quite steep. While how you represent
        the topography is up to you, you should consider how your combatants might utilize
        the terrain to give themselves the advantage.

        <p>
            Battles are the meat and potatoes of Dewprism Tactics. It's why everybody
            is here. On the battlefield your players have a chance to prove
            themselves as heroes, champions, and defenders. As an aside, it is also
            a chance for them to make some money, collect resources, and earn experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each battle should be enough of a challenge to the players that everyone gets at
            least one turn, with the enemy being tough enough that they aren't all wiped-out
            in a single blow. On the other hand, players should feel that their efforts
            have tangible results, that they are - to some degree - strong and capable.
            Thus you want to place enemies between being glass and being sponges.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are essentially two kinds of battles: 1) Hoard Battles and 2) Boss Battles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hoard Battles are your typically group of 3-4 enemies that are all converging
            on your group with the intent to destroy them. These consist of a mishmash of
            different opponents of varying intelligence. Normally these battles range from
            easy to medium in difficulty, and happen all throughout the dungeon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Boss Battles are tests of strength and endurance, fought against a single mighty foe.
            Each dungeon has at least two boss fights: one against a miniboss at the midway point
            and one against the primary boss near the end. <br/>
            <sub>There is technically a third kind of boss: the Final Boss, found
            at the end of the campaign.</sub>
        </p>
        <h2 id="Loot">
            Loot
        </h2>
        <p>
            The real reward from your dungeon excursions comes in the form of <b>loot</b>!
            Loot is anything of value that you get to keep with you. Loot represents more than
            just money, but the improvement of your life in the world of Rasdan. Loot
            lets you buy more helpful items, such as potions, vehicles, and homes.
            Other loot can make you more powerful by granting helpful bonuses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically, the base reward for defeating (not necessarily killing) an enemy
            is based on the monster's level and rank.
        </p>
        <div class="mini">

            Traps and Hazards
        </h2>
        <p>
            Part of the fun of dungeons are the traps and hazards you'll come across.
            These are instances in which characters will have to quickly react with
            a check of some kind, putting their reaction and prowess to the test
            in order to avoid some kind of harm. While the standard trap intends to
            harm your characters, more clever traps can inflict different kinds of
            penalties.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, traps can be found throughout the dungeon and exist
            at all times - in other words, they can be found outside and inside
            of combat. Like with most dungeons, the safer traps should be
            found at the front of the beginning as a means of teaching the players
            the rules of traps and what dangers they pose, while in later
            parts they become more aggressive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most traps are cleverly hidden and are sprung either when the player
            performs an action such as tripping a wire, opening a door, or stepping
            on a secret plate - but they can get more creative than that. Players
            can take the initiative and try to discover these traps in order to avoid
            by first making a Skill self-check. Once the trap has been discovered,
            players can declare their attempt to steer away from it, or try to disarm it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hazards on the other hand aren't deliberately traps, but can pose as threats
            to one's health if not properly navigated. Obstacles such as tall cliffs,
            rooms filled with spilled oil, icy floors, and unstable bridges all count as hazards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like with traps, hazards require an initial check for safe navigation.
            Generally, a Navigation, Scholar, or Craft check should do the trick. However,
            you can also check with your Melee, Magic, or Skill if the need arises (which
            it likely will).
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>
                Below are the difficulty ratings for traps.

        <h1 id="Exploration">
            Exploration
        </h1>
        Exploration is a key part of every adventure. The chance to gain experience, to discover
        something lost, venture to new places, and collect useful supplies. Without the exploration,
        your adventure wouldn't be much of an adventure.
        <h2 id="Foraging">
            Foraging
        </h2>
        <p>While out and about (specifically, outside of combat), you can attempt to forage for materials
        and supplies. Foraging is a check made attempting to collect gil, materials, and consumables
        without having to kill monster for it. However, foraging has the chance to offer rewards
        that couldn't normally be found on monsters. When foraging, you're doing more than just scavenging,
            but you're digging around and looking under every nook and cranny.</p>
        <p>
            Foraging is simple. Outside of combat declare to your DM that you'd like to forage, and then
            make a Harvest check. Make your Talent check, where the higher you roll the better the results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being more specific about your intentions can yield better results by granting bonuses. You can
            mention that you'd like to forage for X amount of hours, that you're looking for a specific
            <i>something</i>, or that you're looking in a certain place. However, being specific
            also increases the chance that you won't find what you were looking for because it simply
            isn't there.

        <h2 id="LevelGrinding">
            Level Grinding
        </h2>
        If your players are under-leveled for an upcoming dungeon and don't want to gain
        levels through side-quests, you can send them out into the wilderness for an indeterminate
            amount of time to kill monsters until they've gained the required experience. It's
        fast, efficient, and keeps the game on tempo.
        <p>
            Obviously, this isn't as fun as going out to do missions, so should only be considered
            if:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                your campaign may be forced to end sooner than you'd hoped, and thus needs to be resolved
            sooner than later, or
            </li>
            <li>
                you haven't prepared any sidequests.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Level-grinding is considered a safe but slow process - you can gain levels, but <i>slowly.</i>
            The higher your level, the slower the process becomes. (Remember, quick and significant growth
            comes from being challenged!)
        </p>
        <div>
            If you're using the Experience method of growth, gain 1000xp per days of level-grinding.<br/>
            If you're using the Milestone method of growth, you must level-grind for as many days as
            is your current level.
        </div>
        <p>
            Keep in mind however that as you gain more levels, the amount of monsters you can meaningfully
            grind XP from decreases. Days turn to weeks, weeks to months, and months to years.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Level 1-4 = days.
            </li>
            <li>
                Level 5-9 = weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Level 10-14 = months.
            </li>
            <li>
                Level 15-19 = years.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="Scouting">
            Scouting
        </h2>
            When entering a new area, you have option to try and scout it. This allows you to fill in the
            blank areas of the map ahead of time, so that you and the other players have an idea of what
            to expect and how to prepare for it. You could even get a sneak-attack on your opponents.
        <p>
            To go scouting, declare to the DM that you want to scout the area. Depending on the size
            of the dungeon, the amount of time to properly scout it will vary - that is of course if you're
            able to access all the areas.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Small area - 0 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Medium area - 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Large area - 2 hours.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Depending on the dungeon you're in, the difficulty of scouting will increase. This means
            that the minimum score you have to get to not get caught by monsters in a fight will increase.
            The difficulty tends to scale with the monster density of an area. Density in this case
            will be a secret number that only the DM knows at first, but can be calculated by taking the total
            number of monsters divided by the total number of rooms.
        </p>
        <sub>You might need a calculator for this.</sub>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <0.5 = 1-5
            </li>
            <li>
                0.5-0.9 = 6-9
            </li>
            <li>
                1-1.5 = 10-15
            </li>
            <li>
                >1.5 = 16-20
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The risk for getting caught is starting combat surrounded by monsters while the rest of
            your party is on the other side of the dungeon. If you fail the scouting check, then you're
            discovered by the monsters and combat instantly starts - everyone rolls for initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, you can break a scouting mission into smaller chunks to make it more manageable.
            Instead of scouting the entire area, you can choose to scout a room at a time. In this case,
            you'll be making checks to sneak past a quantified amount of monsters from one room
            to another.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do this, declare that you'd like to scout the next area through a certain passageway. Your
            character steadily opens the door and peaks through, to which you're shown how many enemies
            are in the room along with what passage ways there are at first glance - then you pull back before
            being spotted. This is when you can decide to make a Skill check against the general
            difficulty of density of the room. If you succeed, then you successfully make it through the room
            to the desires passageway without getting caught and can do it again if you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you want to return, you have to remake all the sneak-checks in reverse order to return to your
            party.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beware, just like with the normal scouting check, if you're caught while sneaking around then combat
            begins.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your allies wish to, they can also join you for sneaking around the area. But they must also
            make their own scouting checks at the same time as you do. If either of you fail, then battle begins.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Spelunking">
            Spelunking
        </h2>
        Spelunking is a combination of scouting and foraging. Instead of going out into the woods to look
        for materials and supplies, you instead delve into a dungeon to look for items that can only be
        found in there. Unlike with scouting, you don't learn the area, you just get items.
        <p>
            To make a spelunking check, you first declare that you're going into the dungeon to go spelunking.
            In this, you combine the potential bonuses from foraging with the dangers
            of scouting.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you succeed in spelunking, you'll return to your party with items that can only be found from
            this dungeon - some of which might not be recoverable even from defeating monsters. But beware,
            if you're caught while out spelunking, you'll end up in combat.
        </p>

            Just like with scouting, you can break the spelunking expedition into chunks by sneaking
            from room to room.

            Travel
        </h1>
        The world is beautiful and mysterious, and for those reason you'll
        want to travel it. Aside from that, your adventures will certainly
        require you to move from town to town, or delve into the wilderness
        to go find some long-lost dungeon. All in all, this section
        aims to provide guidelines traveling it.
        <p>
            To begin, the world is measured in miles (sorry Eurofriends),
            and as such, the world units are measured in it. As a standard,
            every character can travel up to 20 miles in a twelve-hour day.
            This is assumed to be by walking at a reasonable pace.
            However, players can attempt to cover 40 miles by rushing.
        </p>
        <p>
            For every hour of travel at walking-pace, the party member is taxed
            one point of Stamina. If rushing, they're taxed three points
            instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to travel while sleep-deprived, refusing to rest after
            being awake 12 hours, you must pay an additional 1fcs. Just the
            same, rushing while sleep-deprived costs 3fcs instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            However you choose to travel, a Navigate check must be made to
            determine your performance. If traveling without aid of a vehicle,
            one traveler (the leader) makes a Navigate check. Difficulty is determined
            by the method of travel you're taking. Flat lands without incline
            are easiest, while bumpy land and mountains are harder.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is ideal to want to roll higher. As your efficiency increases,
            your speed in miles-per-day improves (20 miles : 12 hours).
            Doing better means instead of 20 miles in a day, you might cover 30
            or even 40.

        Many vehicles have special terms that help you understand how they're
        meant to be used. Below is a list of those terms.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Manual</b> sea vehicles require that you row or pedal them.
                This means that you'll be expending 1sta per mile,
                just as you would on foot. Likewise, manual vehicles
                can be rushed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some air vehicles require that you spend an hour or two in
                preparing
                them. They cannot deploy until the time has been given to
                preparation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Personal</b> vehicles can only carry one person at a time -
                that
                being the pilot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Boats with <b>sails</b> harness the wind to carry them across
                the water. Sometimes, if the wind comes to a standstill, it
                may leave you stranded in the middle of the ocean.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most vehicles come in one of three sizes: <b>small, medium, or
                large.</b>
                These don't mean anything by themselves but will hint towards
                the capabilities of the vehicle in its full details.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h2 id="Sea">
            By Sea
        </h2>
        While swimming, your efficiency is reduced when traveling through water.
        As such, you can only cover 10 miles a day by swimming, at 3sta per
        mile.
        If you rush, you can cover 20 miles a day at 9sta per mile.
        <p>
            Traveling by sea can be perilous. Since you're constantly
            expending energy by being out there, whither you're actually going
            somewhere or not, you must be sure you're able to commit the time
            and resources necessary to make it through.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that if you run out of Stamina (or Focus during night),
            then you'll drown. To improve your chances of survival while
            traveling over water, it is best to have purchased a boat -
            the size is irrelevant.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Land">
            By Land
        </h2>
        Traveling across land on a vehicle isn't too different from traveling
        by foot. The exception being that your vehicle may be pulled by
        a living creature, such as a horse or a ridiculously strong fellow.
        <p>
            Drawn vehicles, such as wagons, don't have a listed Speed score.
            This is because they use half the speed score of the creature
            pulling them.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Air">
            By Air
        </h2>
        Traveling by air is by far faster than either sea and land. The skies
        are open and generally safe from bandits and obstacles. With the
        occasional
        storm, you only have to settle down at the soonest time in order to
        avoid it.
        <p>
            Naturally, most people can't fly. However, several classes do
            provide flight-like abilities. Depending on their use-cost, you can
            fly indefinitely. For everyone else, it isn't difficult to purchase
            an air-vehicle - though it may be a bit pricey.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Vehicles">
            Vehicles
        </h2>
        While it's fun to travel by foot, it is also slow. In a world where
        hunger, deadlines, and money matter, having a faster way of travel
        can be indispensable. Once you've acquired a vehicle, such as horse,
        a boat, or a glider, you'll instantly see results.
        <p>
            Every method of travel has a special variable called Speed,
            which indicates how many miles it can travel in a typical
            12-hour day. While a normal person can travel up to 20 miles a
            day by foot, most vehicles can travel at least 30 - not to mention
            that they don't tax your Stamina.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most vehicles feature a built-in daily cost for operation. Just
            as a traveler requires three meals a day to survive. To make things
            simple, pay a daily amount of Gil and pretend that you went to the
            store and purchased food/parts for your vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, when the maximum unit carry-weight is mentioned,
            assume that every traveler weighs around 15u.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vehicles can rush as well. However, since there is no Stamina score
            to draw from, the daily rate is doubled.

            Buying and Renting
        </h3>
        Settlements such as towns and cities with specialty markets are also
        likely to have transportation merchants. These people can sell or rent
        vehicles, as well as offer bus services.
        <p>
            If you don't travel often, it might be better to rent a vehicle or
            use
            a bus as opposed to buying your own. However, if you travel
            semi-frequently
            and with a party, then investing in a vehicle for everyone
            might be the better solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transport merchants function similar to standard merchants,
            except that they sell/rent vehicles exclusively. This means
            that it's possible to earn discounts with merchants from having
            a good relationship with them - and that it's likely that
            getting onto their bad side will earn you an increased price.
        </p>
        <p>
            Purchasing a vehicle is no different than from purchasing any
            other good. However, renting a vehicle is a little different.
            You must first determine how long you'll be renting the vehicle
            for, wherethen the merchant tallies the total cost and you pay it.
            Except late fees if you return it too late.
        </p>
        <p>
            In simple, the daily rental of a vehicle is equal to 1/5th its
            full price plus the daily rate from each day of use. For example..
        <div>
            If you want to rent a horse for one week (7 days), then you
            must pay 1/5th the price of the horse (500 * 0.2 = 100) plus seven
            days
            worth of daily use costs (20 x 7 = 140), for a total of 240.
        </div>
            If you're an adventurer who daily dabbles in danger and returns
        from every outing with a bag full of precious antiques, then this will
        be quite affordable for you.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Teleport">
            Teleport
        </h2>
        While some class abilities offer the power of short-range teleportation, there exist services
        out there that can enable you to teleport over vast distances - we're talking town to town, country
        to country. This can be exceedingly useful if you're short on time and have money to spare.
        <p>
            Teleportation is done through special stone circles called teleportation pads. Each pad
            is about 10ft wide and can hold up to 20 people at a time. Teleportation is mana-intensive
            and can quickly wear-down the pad, so the cost of use can start out expensive. However,
            there are plenty of people with the funds and requirements to be someplace far away <i>right now.</i>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Next city: 1,000g
            </li>
            <li>
                Next county: 5,000g
            </li>
            <li>
                Across country: 15,000g
            </li>
            <li>
                Across planet: 45,000g
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Keep in mind that not all locations have teleportation pads. They are typically only found in
            cities at certain locations.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h1 id="Time">
            Time
        </h1>
        Time in the world of Rasdan flows much in the same way as it does in our world. There are 24 hours
        in a way, seven days in a week, twelve months in a year - but only 360 days in a year. This means
        that each month only has 30 days. This is for your benefit, to make keeping the calendar easier.
        <p>
            When playing, you typically only measure time spent while traveling or resting. Conversations and
            battles aren't specifically counted, but the DM can round them up into a handful of hours.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Timeskips">
            Timeskips
        </h2>
        There may come times when a certain arc of the campaign has resolved and now the party is waiting
        for things to pick-up again. This might be because the enemy has gone into hiding and will need
        a long time to recover from their losses, or it might be because one of the heroes has taken
        up education and will be busy for the next several weeks or months. Heck, maybe one of the heroes
        has died and we need to wait a few years for his nephew to get old enough to join the party.
        To resolve all of these, the DM is allowed to ask the party if they'd like to do a timeskip.
        <p>
            A timeskip gives players a chance to keep their adventurers meaningfully busy while they wait
            for a period of time to pass. While in a timeskip they get free rein to pursue whatever they want to.
            This can be anything from taking a job to save-up funds, learning a new language, building a home,
            or gaining levels.

            While it's not possible to cover <i>all</i> the possible things you can do in here, there are a
            few things I can mention.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Working a trade (carpenter, smith, cobbler, mason) yields about 100g a day, earning about 600 a week.
                Between expenses (rent, food, repairs), they can save up about 300g in a week.

        Like all worlds, there are various holidays that tend to be observed from nation to nation,
        while a handful of holidays are observed across the world. The global holidays are...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            New Life. The height of Spring, held during the day and ending around 10PM. It celebrates
            warmth and community, having survived through winter. Though in more advanced places where
            surviving the winter isn't that big of a concern, there are still plenty of feasts and festivals.
        </li>
        <li>
            Harvest. Popular all over, it is a day of celebration for a plentiful harvest. It is celebrated with
            delicious beverages (many of which are alcoholic) and tasty treats. Rumor has it that this is
            also when the world of the dead is particularly close to the world of the living.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rain Dance. Though no longer associated with ancient rituals of dancing to invoke rain, Rain Dance
            celebrations are observed all over the globe. It is a time of song, dance, and communal merriment
            as farmers give thanks for the rain that makes crops grow. Meanwhile in the cities, Rain Dance
            is celebrated to give thanks for the rain that relieves the dry, hot heat.

            New Year's. The only weeklong holiday, New Year's celebrations take place during the final
            week of the year and reach their peak on New Year's Eve. It is a time when families and communities
            huddle together for warm meals, songs, and the exchange of gifts. It is a time when the power of togetherness
            prevails against the power of chill and death.
