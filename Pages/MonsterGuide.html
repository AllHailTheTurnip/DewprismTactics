<h1>Monster Guide</h1>
<div class="Side">
    This is the Monster Guide - an in-depth explanation of monster mechanics, how to use them, and a listing
    of their basic scores. Each monster has a level assigned to them, including scores that reflect
    that level. They also have a class and will have access to the abilities of that class - of which
    can be found in the <a href="ClassesDir.html">classes</a> section.

    <h2>
        Codes and Roles
    </h2>
    The world is full of dangerous creatures, and while many of them might end up as your opponents, it should be
    noted that not all creatures think and act same. They each possess varying degrees of intelligence,
    mingled amidst instincts and values. In the treasure hunting field, this is referred to as their
    thinking pattern, or their "code".
    <p>
        Their code is composed of two factors: their intelligence and their role. Their intelligence indicates
        general ability to act in battle, such as how they go about plans, when they'll retreat, and who they'll attack
        first.
    </p>
    <p>
        Factoring is their role - the part they play on their team. The more intelligent the creature, the more easily
        they can re-allocate roles in order to maintain best formation.
    </p>

    Degrees of Intelligence.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Drone - Stupid and incapable of reason or tactics beyond just attacking.<br>
            <i>King Ants, Marionettes, Mandolas, Pumpkins.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            Instinctive - Has a sense of self-preservation and can recognize the threat of a foe
            by their shape, size, and movements.<br>
            <i>Pollywogs, Ootangs, Wabbits.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            Sapient - Possesses emotional and psychological intelligence to make risk/reward
            value judgements; can rationalize if what they're fighting for is worth protecting.
            <i>Bubbas, Witches, Specters, Gamulians, humans. </i>
        </li>
        <li>
            Wise - Can devise strategies to make the fight as easy for them as possible, weighing
            expended effort versus accomplished work.<br>
            <i>Witches, Humans, Bell, Duke, Psycho Master.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            Brilliant - Can actively invent new strategies, tactics, and plans, as if viewing the battle
            from a top-down view, intuitively reading opponents and accurately guessing their every move.<br>
            <i>Atenacous, Wylaf, Phantom Valen, Doll Master.</i>
        </li>
    </ul>

    Combatant Roles.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Bystander - Not actually invested in the fight and just wants to live.
        </li>
        <li>
            Leader - The central tether of the group, granting +2 to decision all their checks.<br>
            If they die, their group may lose confidence and scatter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Soldier - Their role is neutralize the enemy team, defeating the closest opponents first.
        </li>
        <li>
            Support - Their role is to aid their group by offering healing, supplies, and food.
        </li>
        <li>
            Guard - They stay close to a particular member and protect them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hunter - They go after enemy party members that are the most vulnerable.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assassin - They go after the enemy leader. <br>
            Note: The leader is the opposing combatant with the highest initiative.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Decision Making
    </h2>
    Depending on their code, characters can generally predict what a combatant will do during a fight.
    The more intelligent a foe is, the more likely it is to make the intelligent decision, or
    more accurately, the one that makes your life harder.
    <p>
        At the beginning of each turn, the DM makes a check to help determine the intelligence of their actions
        for the round.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Drone</b>. No check made; always the most obvious decision.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Instinctive</b>. 1d20+4 > 20; upon success, an intelligent decision is made.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Sapient</b>. 1d20+8 > 20; upon success, an intelligent decision is made.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Wise</b>. 1d20+12 > 20; upon success, an intelligent decision is made.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Brilliant</b>. No check made; always the most intelligent decision.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As a reminder: a creature's intelligence describes its ability to consistently and properly
        deviate from its own role in order to best serve the goal of its team rather than just
        itself. More intelligent creatures will behave more flexibly, while less intelligent creatures
        behave more rigidly, sometimes doing nothing at all if they fail to deviate from their own role.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the stakes rise, you'll fight many creatures - monsters and people - who are more than
        willing to sacrifice their lives if it means just a chance of stopping you taking what is most precious to
        them or others.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Monster Types
    </h2>
    Over the years, treasure hunters have come across monsters of all shapes and sizes, some larger
    than others. To help categorize these differences, they coined a set of terms that just seemed to
    stick. The bigger they are,
    the stronger they'll be. But keep in mind, the bigger a monster becomes, the more likely they'll
    become the alpha of their group.
    <p>
        By default, all monsters are typed as mobs. To change its type, take the template below and apply
        <b>Factor and Replace</b> (FaR) as necessary.
    </p>
    <div>
        Factor and Replace X (FaR)<br>
        Estimate how many 5's factor into the value, then recalculate the value where 5 is replace with X.
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Runt</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Vitals: FaR 1.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    In essence, if you want to make anything stronger, just multiply its Vitals, Stats's powers,
    and rewards by a number. The listed coefficients are intended to be used for monsters that
    are accompanied by 3-4 mobs.

    <h2>
        Loot and Experience
    </h2>
    By the time combat ends and you stand victorious,
    every enemy that initially challenged you is considered defeated and you are rewarded an amount
    of experience points.
    <p>
        The same applies for loot. Any materials, equipment, gil, and other goodies dropped
        either upon defeat - either when they die, are knocked out, or while they run away.
    </p>
    <p>
        Loot doesn't technically exist to be collected until <i>after</i> the battle has ended.
        At that point, loot (and experience, somehow) is gathered into a pile. By default, experience
        is instantly divided equally (as possible) among the players of the party. From there, players
        can divide the loot among themselves as they see fit - hopefully in a peaceful, rational manner.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Leveling-up Monsters
    </h2>
    If you want to fight stronger monsters, you can level them up. This works in a manner similar to
    how your characters level up.
    <p>
        To do this, you only need a bit of multiplication. First find the base class of the monster
        and multiply its affected scores (vitals, power, dropped experience) by the level you want
        it to become. Make sure when multiplying vitals, that you finally divide its stamina, mana, and focus
        by 5.
    </p>
    <p>
        For leveling-down a monster, you can use the same process described above, but stopping at a lower
        level than the one listed in the Monster Guide.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Custom Monsters
    </h2>
    If you want to create your own monsters, you can follow a simple process. However, it should be
    warned that this is a tricky process, where if you're not careful, you might create a beast
    that's either too powerful or too weak, or just generally unfun. In consideration, all monsters
    have classes that players are also able to take, mix-and-match with - so don't give your custom
    monster something that you wouldn't potentially want the rest of your party having.
    <p>
        To begin,
        at this point, you as the GM will be familiar with monsters enough that you understand the core
        principles of their design, such as balance, focus, and strengths and weaknesses.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Conceptualize</b><br>
            Conceive an idea for the monster you wish to create. Consider their theme, how they
            complement the other monsters, how they challenge the players, their strengths,
            their weaknesses; which classes would be strongest against them and which would have the
            hardest time.
            <p>
                Where do your custom monsters come from? Where can they be found? Are they runts
                or clever? What loot do they drop upon defeat?
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've come up with a concept, write as much of it as you can before going
                onto the next step.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Vitals</b><br>
            Write down the level-1 Vital scores of the monster. Keep in mind that the average base health
            for any mob is 45, meaning it takes exactly 3 hits with an average-grade weapon to defeat it.
            <p>
                For Focus, Stamina, and Mana, the average starting value is 15. These numbers tend
                to fluctuate depending on the class's design, whither they're heavily dependent on
                a particular vital, and how long you want them to be able to last in a fight.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Scores</b><br>
            The most important thing you should think about for a monster's Scores is its element.
            The monster's element indicates where it essentially lies in the critical food-chain.
            If it's a non-standard element like light, metal, or noble, then that means there will be
            fewer classes around that can potentially critically harm it.
            <p>
                Next, consider its Movement score. The average is 4, which is scaled to most battlefields
                such that it can move across an average-sized battlefield from one side to
                the other in 2 rounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its carry score isn't as normally important as a monster, but when a player takes
                its class, it'll determine how much they can carry on their person. This is where you
                might want to consider if a monster would be too dependent on things or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Primary and Secondary Damages aren't immediately determined until you know
                their Stats and which weapons they're equipped with.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Stats</b><br>
            The monster's Stats are going to be the meat of its build - its <i>punch</i>, if you would.
            It determines how quickly it can neutralize an opponent, while also determining
            how long it might take to neutralize it.
            <p>
                The average Power score is 3, while the average Evasion score is 10.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Power score of 4 is considered heavy, and 5 is very heavy - it's rare that a
                monster should start with anything above 4, and unheard of it for it to start at 6+.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine its Evasion scores as a health multiplier for certain attacks. Since 10 is half
                of 20, then naturally, it means only half of the attacks will hit, thereby doubling your
                health. Increasing that to 15 means only one in four attacks are likely to hit,
                while anything higher is unheard of.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Talents</b><br>
            Unlike adventurers, monsters don't develop talents, but instead grow into their talents, as befitting
            their natural abilities. Based on the parts they were born with, they'll better at certain tasks than
            others.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    -2 to -1 is poor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    0-2 is okay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    3-4 is good.
                </li>
                <li>
                    5-6 is great.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Equipment</b><br>
            Monsters typically don't have weapons - but they can have natural weapons, such as claws,
            teeth, spines, tails, and thick skulls. Choose two to be their primary and secondary weapons.
            <p>
                A monster's natural gifts might also count as tools, and can substitute
                for a tool that could be purchased by the players at the store.
            </p>
            <p>
                Few monsters have consumables, and fewer still have anything significant
                they can use, like a revival coin.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Loot and Experience</b><br>
            All mobs drop 100xp, multiplied by their level. Loot, however, is static.
            <p>
                What a monster drops as far as loot is concerned isn't always
                relevant to what the monster what, with the exception of materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, monsters drop materials, which can be used for creating
                items later on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally, minibosses and bosses will drop quest-items necessary
                for advancement in the dungeon or campaign.
            </p>
        </li>
