            Levels and Progression
        </h1>
        <div class="Side">
            Throughout your adventures you'll be challenged and overcome those
            challenges. In doing so you gain
            experience and grow stronger from it. What obstacles were once
            insurmountable become
            mere inconveniences. At the end of your journey you'll look back the
            way you came from and realize that
            the power to overcome was in you all along - it just had to be
            mastered.
        </div>

        <div class="Wide" id="Gaining Experience">
            <h2>Leveling Up</h2>
            Overcoming battles reward the character with experience points that.
            In time, when enough XP is gained,
            they will level-up. The amount of required XP is determined by your
            current level.<br>
            <div style="border: 0px; text-align: center">
                Required XP = 1,000 X Level
            </div>
            Upon reaching or exceeding the threshold, your character's level
            increases by 1 and your XP
            is reset to 0. Don't worry about how long it will take to level-up
            again; if you keep fighting
            monsters of equal level, it'll take the same time as before.<br>
            Once you're out of combat and you've found a rest point, you'll
            enter into the level-up phase,
            during which you may modify your classes,
            modify your abilities, learn a new one, and increase your base
            scores.
            <br>

            <hr>

            <h3>
                Step 1. Your Class
            </h3>
            Upon leveling-up, you get to choose a new class as your primary
            class. Or, if you want, you can re-take the one you
            already have. Whatever you chose, add it to the classes list.
            <p>
                Whatever your primary class now is, you'll choose a new ability
                to learn to the sideboard.
            </p>
            <hr>
            If your character was in possession of a Star Coin when they entered
            the level-up process,
            they may spend the Star Coin to learn the class's Doctrine ability
            instead.
            Once the Doctrine ability is learned, the Star Coin burns hot,
            bright, and cleanly,
            until there's nothing left at all.

            <h3>
                Step 2. Your Vitals, Stats, and Scores
            </h3>
            Increase your max health, melee power, skill power, and magic power
            by adding your class's base scores.
            Increase your max stamina, focus, and mana by adding 1/4th (round
            down) their initial scores
            on top.<br>
            If you had chosen a new class, be sure to update your initiative,
            charge, carry and element values.<br>

            <h3>
                Step 3. Talents
            </h3>
            Choose one of your Talents to increase by 1 point. No talent can go
            above 10.

            <h3>
                Step 4. Abilities
            </h3>
            During level-up, your old abilities list is replaced with the
            abilities from your new one. As an option,
            you may replace up to any amount of your class's abilities (except
            Doctrine and Natural) with abilities from your sideboard.
            <hr>
            <h2>
                Mastery
            </h2>
            Once your character reaches level 20, they become a Master.<br>
            From here on, the title of Master is attached to the title of your
            primary class. As a master, a new aura of
            power surrounds you that wasn't there before. Though you yourself
            are
            only vaguely aware of it, it can be
            easily sensed on an instinctive level by commonfolk and novice
            adventurers. It is compelling, and just a
            little alarming. You'll find that people don't treat you the same
            way they did before.
            <p>
                Additionally, as soon as you take on the master title, you learn
                one of your master-class abilities. Pick
                and choose one from among all the classes on your classes
                list. They're added to your sideboard and can
                be included into your ability list as a regular ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Master-class abilities are incredibly strong and incredibly
                useful. They'll come to define your
                character in the world, helping to establish their legend for
                generations to come.

            <h1>Scaling</h1>
            As you increase in level, it's proper that you as the player should
            have a full understanding of your character's scale in comparison
            to the world around them.
            <p>To begin, as an Adventurer, you're already ahead of the curve
                compared to civilians. Most people are level 0 - and you
                begin the adventure at level 1. What does that look like?
            </p>
            <p>
                At level 1, your health is effectively double that of most
                people. In a way, you're already superhuman, and as your
                level increase, that measure of superhuman-ness only increases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, since most civilians don't have classes,
                then they also don't have abilities. Adventurers really
                are amazing in comparison.
            </p>

                        This may well be your first time adventuring, and you
                        reflect that green-ness in the way your carry yourself.
                        In a way, you're still naive to the actual dangers of
                        the profession, despite all forewarnings.
                        <p>
                            Despite all that, the glimmer of light also
                            reflects the potential you have. If you carry
                            yourself carefully, picking your fights with a
                            discerning eye, and knowing friend from enemy,
                            you'll make it far in life.

                        you were forced to make a decision: retire to a simpler life,
                        or make a commitment to Adventure's call. You chose the latter.
                        <p>
                            Now you have a clearer idea of where you're going in life,

                            You're more comfortable with your newfound abilities,

                            just cool abilities and shiny weapons, but a

                            At this point in your career it's safe to say
                            you aren't the small-fish in the pond anymore.
                            To the civilian world you're like a one-man army.
                            Your strength, fortitude, cunning, and abilities
                            are more than 10x that of mere men.

                        the world really is small. You've become something
                        like a superhuman, possessing power beyond that

                            and spirit as well. There's something bordering on
                            demi-god about you, and the rulers of the world have
                            noticed you. More than likely at this point
                            you've gone into the employment of a nobleman or
