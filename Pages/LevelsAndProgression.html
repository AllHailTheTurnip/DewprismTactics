            Throughout your adventures you'll be challenged and overcome those
            challenges. In doing so you gain
            experience and grow stronger from it. What obstacles were once
            insurmountable become
            mere inconveniences. At the end of your journey you'll look back the
            way you came from and realize that
            the power to overcome was in you all along - it just had to be
            mastered.

            <h2>Leveling Up</h2>
            Dewprism Tactics offers a handful of playstyle options to help bring your
            campaign to life. There are two categories of options: Levels and Growth.
            <p>Before the campaign starts, you and the players should discuss which
            styles of leveling and growth you'd like to use. Some styles are easier
            than others and are more attractive to newer players, while more
            complicated styles help solve issues with long-term games.</p>
            <p>
            Leveling has two modes, which you might already be affiliated with if this
            isn't your first time playing an RPG.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Experience - your character gains XP from the challenges they've
                    overcome.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Milestone - your character levels-up when they complete
                    a significant challenge in the campaign.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            Overcoming battles reward the character with experience points that.
            In time, when enough XP is gained,
            they will level-up. The amount of required XP is determined by your
            current level.<br>
            <div style = "border: 0px; text-align: center">
                Required XP = 1,000 X Level
            </div>
            Upon reaching or exceeding the threshold, your character's level
            increases by 1 and your XP
            is reset to 0. Don't worry about how long it will take to level-up
            again; if you keep fighting
            monsters of equal level, it'll take the same time as before.<br/>
            Once you're out of combat and you've found a rest point, you'll
            enter into the level-up phase,
            during which you may modify your classes,
            modify your abilities, learn a new one, and increase your base
            scores.
            <br/><br/>

            <h2>Milestone</h2>
            More than likely the campaign - from a combat perspective - will have been
            split into a sequence of dungeons, each intended to be taken in their proper
            order based on the party's level. Using Milestone level progression,
            each time you complete one of these dungeons the party will have earned
            another level. Once they reach a rest point in the dungeon, or once they leave
            back for town, they'll level up.
            <p>
                Additionally, the DM can create sidequests that reward the players
                with level much in the same way that a canonical dungeon would. This is
                good for helping make sure that players are strong enough to tackle
                each dungeon in the story.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Step 1. Your Class
            </h3>
            Upon leveling-up, you get to choose a new class as your primary
            class. Or, if you want, you can re-take the one you
            already have. Whatever you chose, add it to the classes list.
            <p>
                Whatever your primary class now is, you'll choose a new ability
                to learn to the sideboard.
            </p>
            If your character was in possession of a Star Coin when they entered
            the level-up process,
            they may spend the Star Coin to learn the class's Doctrine ability
            instead.
            Once the Doctrine ability is learned, the Star Coin burns hot,
            bright, and cleanly,
            until there's nothing left at all.

            <h3>
                Step 2. Your Vitals, Stats, and Scores
            </h3>
            At the same time you decide which leveling method to use, you should
            also choose which growth method you'll be using as well. There are
            two methods to choose from, each with their own advantages.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Linear - growth is done through adding the appropriate scores together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exponential - growth is done through multiplying scores.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Linear
            </h3>
            Intended for players who are new to TTRPG's, linear growth is straightforward
            and simple.
            <p>
            Increase your max health, melee power, skill power, and magic power
            by adding your class's base scores.
            Increase your max stamina, mana, and focus by adding 1/4th (round
            down) of your chosen class's scores.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you had chosen a new class, be sure to update your initiative,
            charge, carry and element values.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Exponential.
            </h3>
            A bit more complicated than Linear, this method aims to solve the issue of power-gap
            between combatants of differing levels at higher ranks. This is because at lower levels
            the score difference is much greater and shrinks rapidly as players approach level 20.
            To solve this, the math switches from addition to multiplication.
            <p>
                From the beginning you'll be granted a multiplier called a Level Bonus, which is based on your current level.
                The Level Bonus will be applied to your Health and Power scores. When
                you take a new class, you'll replace your current Health, Melee Power, Magic Power,
                and Skill Power with the scores from your chosen class. Beside each of them you'll
                list the final result of the base score multiplied by the Level Bonus - these will be
                your acting scores, which will be used primarily during gameplay.<br/>
                <b>Note: Your Stamina, Mana, and Focus scores increase by 1/4th of your chosen class's own stamina, mana, and focus - just like linear.</b>
            </p>

            </h3>
            During level-up, your old abilities list is replaced with the
            abilities from your new one. As an option,
            you may replace up to any amount of your class's abilities (except
            Doctrine and Natural) with abilities from your sideboard.
            <hr>
            <h2>
                Mastery
            </h2>
            Once your character reaches level 20, they become a Master.<br>
            From here on, the title of Master is attached to the title of your
            primary class. As a master, a new aura of
            power surrounds you that wasn't there before. Though you yourself
            are
            only vaguely aware of it, it can be
            easily sensed on an instinctive level by commonfolk and novice
            adventurers. It is compelling, and just a
            little alarming. You'll find that people don't treat you the same
            way they did before.
            <p>
                Additionally, as soon as you take on the master title, you learn
                one of your master-class abilities. Pick
                and choose one from among all the classes on your classes
                list. They're added to your sideboard and can
                be included into your ability list as a regular ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Master-class abilities are incredibly strong and incredibly
                useful. They'll come to define your
                character in the world, helping to establish their legend for
                generations to come.

        <div class = "Wide">
            <h1>Scaling</h1>
            As you increase in level, it's proper that you as the player should
            have a full understanding of your character's scale in comparison
            to the world around them.
            <p>To begin, as an Adventurer, you're already ahead of the curve
                compared to civilians. Most people are level 0 - and you
                begin the adventure at level 1. What does that look like?
            </p>
            <p>
                At level 1, your health is effectively double that of most
                people. In a way, you're already superhuman, and as your
                level increase, that measure of superhuman-ness only increases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, since most civilians don't have classes,
                then they also don't have abilities. Adventurers really
                are amazing in comparison.

                        reflect that green-ness in the way your carry yourself.
                        In a way, you're still naive to the actual dangers of
                        the profession, despite all forewarnings.
                        <p>

                            reflects the potential you have. If you carry
                            yourself carefully, picking your fights with a
                            discerning eye, and knowing friend from enemy,

                            To the civilian world you're like a one-man army.
                            Your strength, fortitude, cunning, and abilities
                            are more than 10x that of mere men.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Looking behind yourself, you see thousands of bodies
                            - those who tried to go the distance and failed.
                            Looking beyond, you see the next generation of
                            Adventurers. Yet worse, your experience has granted
                            you insight into who will survive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Looking ahead, the actual threats to yourself
                            are easily quantifiable. Your enemies can be named,
                            and threats to the world are also your problem.
                            The rich, the elite, and the powerful are now aware
                            of you, and soon they'll demand you take a side.

                        Near the top of the mountain, you look out and see that
                        the world really is small. You've become something
                        like a superhuman, possessing power beyond that
                        of your wildest dreams. The world feels much more
                        fragile than it used to be.
                        <p>
                            At this point in your career, you've clearly
                            proven that you're more than just muscle, but mind
                            and spirit as well. There's something bordering on
                            demi-god about you, and the rulers of the world have
                            noticed you. More than likely at this point
                            you've gone into the employment of a nobleman or
                            two.

                            Looking back, it seems that your youth are so far
                            away; you remember being level 1 and thinking
                            you were so tough. Though that sparkle of ignorance
                            is gone, your fundamental nature has not changed,
                            for which you are thankful.

                        You reached the top of the mountain and now the whole
                        world is spread out before you. You were right all along;
                        the world really is small.
                        <p>
                            Your career has reached its zenith, and now there's
                            nowhere left to go. Yet you certainly won't
                            go down without a fight.
                        </p>

                            In a kind of irony, since your strength can no
                            longer pull you up, you have nothing left but
                            your wisdom. All the causes you fought for
                            were certainly noble, but you know better now
                            that these problems could've been solved better
                            with peace - if only people were more patient.

                            Yet as the sun sets, the stars appear.
                            You still have a long ways to go.
