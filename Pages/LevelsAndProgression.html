    Levels and Progression
</h1>
<div class="Side">
    Throughout your adventures you'll be challenged and overcome those challenges. In doing so you gain
    experience and grow stronger from it. What obstacles were once insurmountable become
    mere inconveniences. At the end of your journey you'll look back the way you came from and realize that
    the power to overcome was in you all along - it just had to be mastered.
</div>

<div class="Wide" id="Gaining Experience">
    <h2>Leveling Up</h2>
    Overcoming battles reward the character with experience points that. In time, when enough XP is gained,
    they will level-up. The amount of required XP is determined by your current level.<br>
    <div style="border: 0px; text-align: center">
        Required XP = 100 X Level
    </div>
    Upon reaching or exceeding the threshold, your character's level increases by 1 and your XP
    is reset to 0.<br>
    Once you get the chance, you'll enter into the level-up phase, during which you may modify your classes,
    modify your abilities, learn a new one, and increase your base scores.
    <br>

    <hr>
    <h3>
        Step 1. Your Class
    </h3>
    Upon leveling up, you're given the chance to choose a new class to make your primary class, or
    to take another level in your current primary class. Choosing a new primary class will affect your
    base abilities stats, and scores. If you chose to retake an old class, you'll increase its class level,
    measuring how many times you've taken it. All learned classes are written down to the classes list.
    <p>
    Whatever your primary class now is, you'll choose a new ability to learn to the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your character was in possession of a Star Coin when they entered the level-up process,
        then they're allowed to learn the innate ability of the class they've taken. Taking an innate ability
        counts as the ability the one ability they were allowed to learn, and in doing so that ability is
        treated as a regular sideboarded ability. Once the innate ability is learned, the Star Coin burns
        hot, bright, and cleanly, until there's nothing left at all.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Step 2. Your Vitals, Stats, and Scores
    </h3>
    Increase your max health, melee power, skill power, and magic power by re-adding the initial scores
    again. Increase your max stamina, focus, and mana by adding 1/4th (round down) their initial scores
    on top.<br>
    If you had chosen a new class, be sure to update your movement, charge, carry and element values.<br>

    <h3>
        Step 3. Abilities
    </h3>
    During level-up, you're allowed to reconfigure your list of abilities from the base abilities of your
    current class with up to five sideboard abilities.
    <hr>
    <h2>
        Mastery
    </h2>
    Once your character reaches level 20, they become a Master.<br>
    From here on, the title of Master is attached to the title of your primary class. As a master, a new aura of
    power surrounds you that wasn't there before. Though you ourself are only vaguely aware of it, it can be
    easily sensed on an instinctive level by commonfolk and novice adventurers. It is compelling, and just a
    little alarming. You'll find that people don't treat you the same way they did before.
    <p>
        Additionally, as soon as you take on the master title, you learn your master-class abilities. Pick
        and choose three from among all the classes on your classes list. They're added to your sideboard and can
        be included into your ability list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Master-class abilities are incredibly strong and incredibly useful. They'll come to define your
        character in the world, helping to establish their legend for generations to come.
