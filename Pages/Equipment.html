<!--
E:
Stasis Cube: May contain a single item of any size, rendering it timeless, useless, powerless, weightless, etc. until taken out.

Gravity Cape: Enables flight when equipped. Half speed when flying.

Ancestral Flute: When played, everyone who hears it heal 1d20 HP (one roll).

Channeler's Gloves: Spend a turn focusing to gain 20% of your maximum mana.

D:

Scroll of Fire: Boost damage of all fire-based attacks by 1.

Blast Gloves: Generate a contained explosion within a non-living object touched, utterly destroying the object or at the least rendering it unusable. (Rocks, boulders, mugs, tables, walls...clothing.)

Double Strike Gauntlet: Any physical attack with or without a weapon while using this gauntlet strikes twice in extremely quick succession, dealing half normal damage with each strike (roll for damage twice). (If critical hits exist, both hits have their own chance. This ineffectively doubles the chance at a critical hit; on average it is weaker than simply doubling crit chance.)

C:

Boomstick: Fire a single-target ranged fireball.

Book of Life: For every minute this book is read, heal 1 HP. The contents are difficult to read and require concentration, but it is assumed to be gibberish as no one is able to recall anything read in this book.

Maelstrom Flask: Open it to absorb a projectile spell. The next time it is opened will fling the spell wherever the Flask is aimed.

B:

Chaos Sphere: Charge/Focus for N turns, unable to do any other actions. After charging, all enemies within an area of N * 5 meters take N * your level in damage. Once per day.

Mega Pearl: Roll a d20.
1-5 = Nothing happens.
6-10 = Self heal 10 HP.
11-15 = Self and nearby entities heal 10 HP.
16-20 = Self and nearby allies heal 10 HP.

A:

Tome of Secrets: (Outside battle only.) Focus on a single topic/question for up to an hour in order to open it and read everything anyone has ever known about that topic/answer.

Chicken Compass: Once per day, alter the local weather. Conjure a storm, clear the sky, create a tornado, fly uncontrollably with powerful wind...

S:

(none but the Dewprism)

It is possible to have another S-tier relic if an Aeon did not care to flaunt their power and share to the world what they had created. That is up to the creative liberties of the GM.
