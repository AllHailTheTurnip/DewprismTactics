    Combat
</h1>
<div class="Side">
    Treasure hunting is a lucrative and (often) noble business, taking you all across the world from lush and
    rainy forests, all the way into the forgotten depths of the earth through catacombs and dungeons.
    Yet no matter how carefully you may have planned it out, you'll come across some kind of opponent at one point
    or another. <br>
    <p>And that's okay, because you're a treasure hunter. Naturally, you come equipped with the skills and
        abilities necessary to see you through the battle safely and in (mostly) one piece.</p>
    <p>
        But beware, though. The world is full of powerful creatures with sharp teeth, keen wits, and bit of magic
        to boot. A treasure hunter's best asset will be their wisdom, in particular, knowing their limits.

        Turns and Actions
    </h2>
    Combat begins when one party instigates a fight with another party. This happens either when one or more
    combatants realize that a fight is about to start and choose to take the initiative, or when they're attacked.
    <p>
        In the case of being attacked, as soon as the attack action is resolved, initiative is calculated. Otherwise,
        when reacting to a threat, you calculate initiative as normal.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Combat ultimately ends when there are no more combatants left to carry on the fight, either on your
        side or the enemy's side. Combatants can be neutralized either by leaving the battlefield (fleeing), by
        being killed, or by being otherwise incapable of fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the battle ends, XP and loot is given out to the players in exchange for the creatures they helped
        defeat. Enemies that've been neutralized without being killed are at the players' mercy.
           They may decide if the enemy combatants die of their wounds, or if they remain knocked-out.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Targeting
    </h3>
    Many actions and abilities require you to target another combatant. There is a variety of ways
    with which you can target an opponent. Each way is different, in that it has its own limits.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Nearby</b><br>
            Often weapons with an enhanced range will also allow you to aim diagonally.
            An attack against a target within the same space as you with either a melee or ranged ability or weapon.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Line of Sight (LoS)</b><br>
            The attack travels up to its range specification and will damage the first target it comes
            across.<br>
            It cannot skip combatants or travel through walls.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Instant</b><br>
            The attack has a range but ignores walls and combatants standing between you and your target.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Unless specified, if an ability only has range specified, assume it's a projectile. If it has neither
    range nor targeting parameter, assume it's melee. Finally, if the ability itself has no range attribute,
    then the effect is universal - meaning it is uninhibited by range.

    <h3>
        Initiative
    </h3>
    At the beginning of combat, each combatant draws their weapons and readies to fight.<br>
    Every combatant rolls 1d20, adding in their Initiative score. Whoever rolls highest goes first.s
    <p>
        If two or more combatants get the same score, then they roll again, marking their score with an A or B to
        indicate who goes first.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the combatants, an initiative labeled "COUNTERS" is created. COUNTERS is granted an initiative
        score of 99, always going first. There is no COUNTERS combatant, and is used solely to help players remember
        when to update their counters and other start-of-round effects.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Surprise Attacks
    </h4>
    If a combatant (or the party) was caught off guard as combat began - such that none of them were
    expecting a fight to happen at that very moment - they roll as normal, but their weapon is not drawn.


    <h3>
        Turns and Rounds
    </h3>
    Battle is measured in turns and rounds. Once per round each player takes their turn, starting
    from highest to lowest. A turn (in-game) typically lasts 5 seconds. Once all players have taken their turns,
    the round ends and a new one begins.
    <p>
        When it's a player's turn, they first update any counters/timed effects that are on their person.
        Any extra effects, such as poison, gradual healing, or burn, are then applied. Finally,
        they are granted 20 Action Points (AP) with which to spend on actions. Common
        actions and abilities all use AP.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Using Actions and Abilities
    </h3>
    Actions and abilities are seldom free and must be paid for with AP and/or vital resources.<br>
    <p>
        All basic actions require an amount of AP, while almost all abilities require AP and an amount
        of stamina, mana, and focus. While you're able to spend an excess of AP and be stuck charging,
        you cannot spend more of a vital resource (mana, stamina, focus) than what you have, and if you
        don't have enough, then the ability can't be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subtract the required resources from your character as indicated by Use attribute. Resources
        such as AP, Stamina, Mana, and Focus, may be listed there. If no AP is listed, then the score does
        not cost AP to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some abilities, as part of their Use attribute, can only be invoked a limited amount of times
        per battle. This is listed as X/battle or X/Round, where X is most often 1 or 3.
        Even if you have enough resources to invoke the ability, if you've used it too many
        times, you cannot use it again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though not as common, some abilities that spawn objects like weapons, potion, and buildings,
        will require an amount of materials to build. Like spending vitals and AP, you'll spend
        the listed materials as part of the Use condition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every once in a while, you may see the variable X in the use cost, such as with XAP or Xsta.<br>
        This means that you spend as much of the resources as you want, in affect setting the value
        of other X's in the ability.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Status Effects
    </h4>
    Status effects are temporary modifiers that most often hinder your performance. It might be that
    you're bleeding and will soon pass out, or that maybe you've been blessed with great accuracy.
    <p>
        When you get a status effect, you can only have it once and must wait until it has worn off
        or is removed for you to take the status effect again. This also means that status effects
        cannot stack effects.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Charging Actions
    </h3>
    You cannot make an action if you can't offer enough AP - however, you can choose to <b>charge</b> it instead.
    In charging an action, you spend any remaining AP on the action and remain in place while you wait for more AP
    from your next turn. While charging, you cannot
    make reactions or actions, and all of your Evasion scores are reduced to 0.
    <p>
        When your next turn comes around
        and you are granted more AP, the amount is automatically spent on your charged action. Once the action is fully
        paid for, the action is finally made.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Pay by Burn
    </h4>
    Some AP costs have an exclamation mark (!) attached, meaning that the ability can be burned.
    If you don't have the AP but still have the Stamina, Mana, and/or Focus, you may execute the ability immediately,
    driving your AP into the negatives. Afterwards you're in cooldown, where the normal rules of charging are in affect
    until your AP is above 0 again. This cannot be canceled.
</div>
<div class="Wide">
    <h2 id="BattleTransience">
        Battle Transience
    </h2>
    The first rule of combat is Battle Transience: <i>what happens in battle, stays in the battle.</i>
    Or more accurately, any changes made to your character are undone
    after the end of the battle. You might think of combat as though it were an alternate reality from
    the one you started in. This essentially covers anything done to you or your allies through actions and abilities,
    such as changes to your vital scores, status effects, and markers, counters, props, and mobs.
    <p>
        There are a few exceptions.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Death. If you die in combat, you'll remain dead after it unless you spend a revival coin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Revival Coins. If you revive yourself with a revival coin, the coin will remain lost after combat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rewards. Your victories in combat are remembered and rewarded. After combat, you'll
            receive experience points and drops from the creatures you slayed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Consumables. Potions, rations, antidotes, and other limited-use remain used.
        </li>
    </ul>
    In the same respect, if you come into battle with missing equipment or stat changes, anything you
    did in combat to change those values are undone to the way before at the start. Minor encounters
    and obstacles don't count as combat, and may tax you in small ways before the real battle.
    <p>
        Though it may not seem like it at first, battle transience is ultimately to the advantage of your character.
        You don't have to overstock on equipment, allowing you to travel lighter and more battle-ready. Though
        any bonuses from your abilities don't last, any lost equipment and penalties that would have been permanent
        in battle are recovered.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Enlarged Scope
    </h3>
    As an optional rule, the players (including the DM) can enlarge the scope of Battle Transience
    to include other measurable sequences of time and space, such as the dungeon itself, the entire day,
    or the entire week.
    <p>
        This is for the purpose of making the game just a bit harder, since then, resources would remain
        lost longer and player revivals would have to wait longer.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if the transience was increased
        to cover the entire dungeon and not just the battles inside, if a player character died in one of the
        battles, then even though they had a revival coin on their person, the coin wouldn't take effect
        until after the rest of the party decided to head back to town.
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Dungeon Transience</b><br>
            Battle Transience would not take effect until after the players left the dungeon or general area.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Safepoint Transience</b><br>
            Battle Transience would not take effect until you've returned to your base of operations, such as a
            resupply area, a town, a rest-area in a dungeon, or your wagon.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Campaign Transience</b><br>
            Battle Transience does not take effect until after the campaign has ended.
        </li>

        <h2 id="Weapons">
            Weapons
        </h2>
        Weapons are the basis of a capable warrior. If you run out of any of you resources, you'll
        still have your weapons equipped to help you deal out damage.
        <p>
            You have two slots for weapons: primary and secondary. <br>
            Primary weapons are equipped to your dominant hand, while secondary weapons are equipped
            to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every weapon has a set of scores that explain how it is used and how it behaves.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Type</b><br>
                Determined which of your Damage scores will benefit from this weapon's ranking.
                Some abilities are dependent on your weapon's typing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Weight Class</b><br>
                Abbreviated as WC, Weight Class indicates how physically heavy your weapon is. The heavier
                it is, the more damage it does. However, heavier weapons cost more in resources to use.<br>
                There are five official weight-class listings.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        VL. Very Light. The weapon is very small, weighing very little and dealing little damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        L. Light. The weapon is small.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        M. Medium, or average. The weapon is properly sized for the average person.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        H. Heavy. The weapon requires more strength and effort to use, but deals more damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        VH. Very Heavy. The weapon is over-sized and requires a lot of effort to use.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use</b><br>
                How much it costs to use your weapon. All weapons cost Action Points to use, while
                heavier ones also cost stamina.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Rank</b><br>
                Listed in between parenthesis (most often beside the damage variable).
                The higher the ranking score, the better the final result will be.<br>
                Your critical score for base damage is also determined from your weapon's rank by increasing it by 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Weight</b><br>
                Abbreviated as Wt, which measures in units (nothing too specific) how much the weapon weighs
                you down. You must be careful, as heavier weapons can quickly over-encumber you.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Attributes</b><br>
                Your weapon attributes indicate what special abilities your weapon has. A general list of
                attributes can be found in the <a href="Equipment.html#WeaponAttributes">equipment</a> section.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>
        Attributes can be very effective. Throughout your adventures, it is even possible to enhance the properties
        of an attribute to make it even more effective. Just about any attribute can be enhanced.
        <p>
            Attributes with a plus-sign (+) beside indicate that their property has been enhanced.
            How this enhancement effects the attribute can be found in the <a href="Equipment.html#WeaponAttributes">weapon attributes</a> listing in

    <h2 id="CommonActions">
        Common Actions
    </h2>
    Every combatant possesses a set of basic actions that they can perform regardless of their primary class. These
    are called common actions.
    <p>
        To make an action, first declare which action you want to make, then spend the AP. Some actions
        require that you spend Stamina, Focus, or Mana, or else they won't work. You may also be required
        to roll dice to see if the action works.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h3>
        Movement
    </h3>
    AP Cost: 10<br>
    Declare that you are moving and to where.<br>
    Move to any adjacent space connected to your space with a dotted border.<br>
    You cannot enter into a space unless its border is dotted.

    <h4>
        Difficult Terrain
    </h4>
    It costs 15AP to move into terrain that is terribly bumpy, cluttered, or otherwise difficult to navigate.<br>
    Often, difficult terrain will require a check to enter or leave from. This check will test either your
    Melee, Skill, or Magic Power scores against a difficulty.

    <h4>
        Bottomless Pits
    </h4>
    If you fall into a bottomless pit, fear not! for you only take a quarter of your max health
    in damage, and if you survive, you'll return to the battlefield at your starting
    position on your next turn.
    <br><sub>Lava counts as a bottomless pit.</sub><br>

    <h4>
        Ascending and Descending
    </h4>
    Most maps have varying topography, with ramps, stairs, and hills to help the player reach higher elevations. <br>
    Spaces of steeply varying heights, such as stairs and rock-walls, are treated as difficult terrain.

    <h4>Fall Damage</h4>
    If you are pushed off a ledge and into the air, you'll fall to the ground and take neutral damage
    equal to 15 times however many spaces you fell. You do not take fall damage for not leaving your space.

    <h4>
        Swimming
    </h4>
    You may swim through water and other thin liquids, treating it as difficult terrain.
    <br>You will suffocate (and die) if you're under water for more than 3 turns.

    <hr>
    <h3>
        Basic Attack
    </h3>
    AP Cost: [see weapon AP cost] <br>
    Declare who you are attacking and which weapon you'll be using to do it.
    You may attack any combatant that is within the same space as you.<br>
    First, make a hit check and compare against your opponent's melee evasion score. If the result
    meets or exceeds their evasion, the attack hits.<br>
    If you used a melee-type weapon, you'll deal Melee Damage, whereas if you used a skill-type weapon, you'll inflict skill damage, and so on.
    <h4>Critical Success and Failure</h4>
    If your hit check rolled a natural 20, you use your Crit score for damage instead.
    Additionally, if your hit check rolled a natural 1, any additional action for the rest of the turn, use cost is increased by 50%.<br>
    Please note: Class abilities use different critical rules.
    <h4>
        Non-Lethal Attacks
    </h4>
    If you want to simply knock an opponent out, rather than potentially kill them, you can declare that
    your attack is non-lethal. If the attack hits, it will do enough damage to reduce the target's health
    to 0.
    <h4>
        Ranged Attacks
    </h4>
    Some weapons, such as bows, crossbows, slings, and magic staffs, can also make ranged attacks by firing
    projectiles. As part of their attributes, a type of projectile is listed - either your mana, or one
    from your inventory. Whenever a ranged attack is made, one of the projectiles is removed from your
    inventory.
    <p>
        Ranged weapons have a range score listing their minimum and maximum ranges. Measure the distance in spaces.
        If the target is in the same space as you, the distance is 0. If they're in the next space over,
        it's a distance of 1, and so on. <br>
        If the target is out of your distance, the attack will fall short.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, if the target is in the same space as you but you don't have ammo, you can make
        a melee attack at it, treating the weapon's Pwr score as 1 instead.
    </p>
    <h4>
        The High Ground
    </h4>
    Your attack checks gain +3 for every 1 space of elevation you have over an opponent.<br>
    You may make ranged attacks against combatants that are more than 1 space above or below you.

    <h4>
        Stealth and Hiding
    </h4>
    Before combat has started, or if you're currently unseen, you can attempt to enter Stealth
    by making a skill-evasion check, adding your Acrobatics talent to the Evasion score. Upon success,
    you are hidden.
    <p>
        If you move to another space, make the check again to remain in Stealth. Some terrain
        conditions, such as darkness, or intense light, or glass on the ground, can either
        grant advantage or disadvantage to your checks - at GM discretion.
    </p>

    <h4>Sneak Attacks</h4>
If you attack an unsuspecting opponent, either before battle has started, or if they are unable to respond (or unconscious),
    your attack automatically hits for critical damage.
<hr>
    <h3>
        Defending with Shield
    </h3>
    AP Cost: 10<br>
    Declare that you are defending and which shield you'll be using. Add the shield's Protection
    to your Health until the start of your next turn.<br>
    The shield's protection score is not damaged by defending - only the bonus health. If the health bonus is depleted,
    any excess damage rolls over.

    <h3>
        Guarding

    <h3>
        Unarmed Attacks
    </h3>
    Your kicks and punches also count as weapons with a power level equal to 1. They are non-lethal
    and you cannot reduce an opponent's health below 0 with them.

    <h3>
        Use Equipment
    </h3>
    AP Cost: 5<br>
    Declare that you wish to use either one of your weapon, tools, materials, or consumables,
    and how you wish to use it. By this action you can:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Swap, draw, equip, store one of your weapons,
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Swap, equip, or store one of your tools.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Additionally, with any piece of equipment, you can give one one of them to an adjacent ally, granted
    that they are also willing to accept the equipment into either their inventory or into a free hand. In the case
    of stacked items, you may treat them as a single item when giving or receiving. Finally, if you just don't
    want an object, you can drop it on the ground, where it will remain until destroyed or recovered by another
    combatant.
    <p>
        As a note: temporary bonuses gained from consumables cannot stack if used in succession.
    </p>

    </h3>
    Withhold an action to use later on in the round.<br>
    AP Cost: 5 + action's cost.<br>
    Declare which action (or ability) you are withholding. During the round, either at the beginning or end
    of a combatant's action, you may finally use the action. If you don't use the action, it is lost at
    the beginning of your next turn and no AP (or resources) is refunded.
    <hr>

    <h3>
        Talent Checks
    </h3>
    AP Cost: 5 <br>
    Declare that you'd like to make a Talent check and wait for the DM to determine how difficult it will be
    to accomplish. A larger scale check may also require more AP to fulfill, and may even require more than
    one turn.
    <br>First spending the AP and then make the check. Upon success, the task is fulfilled as usual.<br>

    Keep in mind that Efficiency checks are impossible in combat.

    <hr>
    <h3>
        Execute
    </h3>
    AP Cost: 15 <br>
    While an opponent is unconscious or in the KO state and you're alone with them in the same square, you can kill
    them.
    This means reducing their Health points to negative-half their full amount.

    <hr>
    <h3>
        Befriend
    </h3>
    AP Cost: 5 <br>
    If a monster's intelligence code is either drone, instinctive, or sapient, you can move
    into the same space and toss a Monster Treat at its feet.
    <p>
        Make a Luck check.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Drone</b><br> Beat 16
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Instinctive</b><br> Beat 18.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Sapient</b><br> Beat 20.
        </li>
    </ul>
    To improve your chances, reduce the difficulty by 1 for every 1/4 of its Health
    it's missing.
    <p>
        Upon success, the monster becomes neutral to your party and will no longer want to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of combat, roll luck 10, and if you're successful, the
        monster will come submissively creeping out of the bushes and join beside
        the party. It is now your new ally, and will no longer attack your party when you pass
        through the territory again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Should you return with a Monster Collar, you can equip it to the friendly monster's Tool
        slot, in which it is now an official member of your party. It gets a name, a character sheet,
        can gain experience and level-up, and eventually gain Master status.
        You can take it with you into town without drawing the attention of the guards, and some
        hotels will even allow it inside.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep in mind, however, that while it's possible to befriend minibosses
        and bosses, once they join your party, they lose their miniboss/boss
        status and regain the stats of regular party members.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, only Sapient monsters
        can use equipment without assistance from another party member.

<div class="Wide">
    <h2 id="MetaLogic">
        Meta Logic
    </h2>
    While in combat, it is assumed that the written rules come first everyone is bound to the same basic combat rules, such that narrative sense
    comes second; that abilities and actions do as they are assumed
    to for everyone, all the time.
    <p>
        This is the for benefit of the players that, if they know the rules, then they can generally
        know what to expect from enemies and from each other. </p>
    <p>
        Though you might wish to be creative - and there will be times when that is allowed - your creative
        endeavors may not always be possible. If they are, then it should be expected that your enemies
        will take the same liberties you have.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="Wide">
    <h2 id="Abilities">
        Abilities
    </h2>
    Abilities are special actions that are best understood as simple programs. They contain common keywords, use
    conditions,
    and instructions that tell you how the ability works, when it can and can't be used. When executing
    an ability, read along its attributes from beginning to end, executing instructions as their
    conditions are met.<br>
    <h3>
        Application
    </h3>
    <p>
        When considering an action, first refer to its application identifier.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Actions are only used on your turn.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reactions are only used in response to an event.
        </li>
        <li>
            Passives can be used at any time.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Outside of Combat
    </h3>
    When using abilities outside of combat, such as prior to battle, your pre-battle state is saved, such that
    when battle transience takes effect, your scores revert as normal. This can be of disadvantage, because you are
    using your resources for all future conflicts, until you can recover from potions or from a rest.
    <p>
        Permanent buffs, or buffs without a listed expiration, only last an hour of non-combat time. Traveling, or
    general roleplaying, will quickly reduce and undo those buffs (or debuffs)
    </p>

    <h3>Placeholders</h3>
    Most abilities also have variable values that, as your character grows, also grow.
    These are called placeholders, and they are identified as a single number appended
    by a set of curly-braces with an abbreviate stat inside. Each placeholder is meant
    to be used for multiplication, where the initial number is multiplied by the power level
    of the referenced stat.<br>
    For example...
    <ul>
        <li>
            2{MgcPwr} is read as 2 x Magic Power.
        </li>
        <li>
            3{SklPwr} is read as 3 x Skill Power.
        </li>
        <li>
            4{MlePwr} is read as 4 x Melee Power.
        </li>
    </ul>
    If a placeholder doesn't have a number listed, assume it is 1. <br>
    Other placeholders also include...
    <ul>
        <li>
            CL, representing as Class Level, how many levels you've taken in your current class.
        </li>
        <li>
            TL, representing Total Level, your character's overall level.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Accuracy
    </h3>
    Many abilities have an Accuracy attribute that indicate a d20 must be rolled and a difficulty score
    beaten before the effects of the ability can be executed. After you've paid for the ability,
    make a d20 check. If the check passes, then the Ability's OnPass/OnHit attribute is invoked.
    <p>
        Hit checks will refer to the enemy Evasion score that the ability is targeting in a
        <i>Accuracy: [Evasion]</i> format. Many checks are just Luck rolls, and will read <i>Luck: X</i>,
        where X is a value between 1 and 20.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, if you roll a natural 20 on an ability, its rank (found between parenthesis) increases by
        1 for the rest duration of the check.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Range
    </h3>
    Many Abilities have range specifiers that indicate how close (or far away) a combatant
    has to be in order for the ability to be able to target them. Most often this is limited to
    how close something is, but some special attack require they be further away than the listed score.
    A more-than sign (>) specifies that the target must be equal to or further than the listed score.
    <p>
        Some abilities allow you to choose a target within a space, or series of spaces, or the whole battlefield.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Beams</b> target every combatant within a line of range; every space that would be touched
            by a line is considered part of the range.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Trigger
    </h3>
    Reaction abilities are used in response to an action or event, most often in response to
    an enemy combatant. Once a Trigger's condition(s) have been met (if listed, you may choose to pay
    the Use cost) and then execute the rest of the Ability.
    <h3>
        Common Status Effect Keywords.
    </h3>
    Below is a list of common keywords. Though you'll see more keywords, keep in mind that they are all
    self-explanatory.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Create. An object, such as a weapon or a token, is created from thin air.
        </li>
        <li>
            Destroy. Opposite of Create, an object is turned into thin air.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make an [Action]. You make a free action.
        </li>
        <li>
            Restore. Something that was damaged, such as a vital score or a stat, is restored by an amount.

        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Immune To. The target becomes immune to a certain damage, effect, or other specifier.
        </li>
        <li>
            Worthless To. The target can no longer affect a target with a certain target.

    <h3>
        Knocked Out
    </h3>
    When your character's health is reduced to 0, they become Knocked Out (KO). While in the
    Knocked Out status, all of your character's Evasion scores are reduced to 0 and you
    cannot make actions or reactions.
    <p>
        While knocked-out, you cannot take damage unless an ability specifically allows it. <br>
        Unless executed or revived, your character will remain unconscious for the rest
        of the battle.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Death

    Once your health reaches negative-half its max score, your character is dead. Their spirit has departed
    from their person and all biological functions have ceased to continue.

        If there was a revival coin on your person at the time of the battle's end, then the coin is destroyed
        and your character comes back to life with an amount of health, determined by the quality of the coin.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h3>Return by Death</h3>
    In the event of a permanent death or team kill, players can petition the DM to invoke the rule of
    Return by Death.
    The entire escapade up to that moment is rescinded, returning the team back to their last
    safe location (such as the town inn). The team find themselves wrapping up a discussion about
    a hypothetical scenario in which one or more of them all die in battle.
    Being disregarded as being highly unlikely, if not entirely impossible, the team laughs it off.
    However, as they step away from the table to resume their adventure, each of them carries the
    burdensome memory of that past life, the pain of watching their friends die,
    and the sting of their own real death. They will never again be quite the same...
    <h3>
        Rechallenging NPC's
    </h3>

    <hr>
    Any battles the players have already proven themselves at can be won again at no cost to their coins.
    This way, the players can easily return to their previous fights, or find a point to branch off from
    and try from another direction.



</div>
<div class="Wide">
    <h2 id="SmallEncounters">
        Small Encounters
    </h2>
    Smaller, lower-stakes battles can be reduced to obstacle-like encounters that each combatant completed
    by making a check against. These encounters offer rewards and penalties like any other battle, but with
    one major twist: since they're part of narrative time, they are exempt from the rule of battle transience.
    With small encounters taxing the party's resources, larger battles will become more significant.
    <p>
        A small encounter can be anything from a fight against a small group of monsters,
        to overcoming a tall obstacle. Each are treated the same way and pose similar penalties for
        failure.
    </p>
    <p>
        The DM first presents the small encounter either as mandatory or as optional. In a mandatory
        encounter, the obstacle has surprised the players and they <i>must</i> react; likewise, in an
        optional encounter, the obstacle has been noticed first and the players have the ability to turn
        around.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some encounters may require materials or tools to be able to complete, such as in repairing a broken
        bridge, or in swimming to the bottom of a lake. In the case of materials, before any checks are made,
        the players must come together and provide the required materials. With mandatory tools, only players
        with the proper tools can make the check.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any players participating in tackling the encounter each make a check to overcome it. The difficulty
        is determined by the DM by looking at the scale and potential threat of the encounter, then giving
        it a score between 8 and 25. Obstacles with a difficulty below 8 should not be considered
        serious obstacles, being too easy to overcome. Difficulties over 20 should be considered potentially
        too difficult for players to overcome.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Obstacles
    </h3>
    In the case of an obstacle, the DM prompts the players to make an efficiency check against the determined
    difficulty score. Upon success, the players overcome the obstacle normally. Upon failure, the players
    still pass the obstacle, but with a penalty such as time, resources, and potentially - a revival coin.
    <p>
        The DM can determine how well passing and failing turns out based on the below list.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Pass by 0 or higher</b>: General success; average time taken and no extra resources consumed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Pass by 6 or higher</b>: Great success; completed 50% faster than average with only 50% of
            expected resources consumed.

            <b>Pass by 12 or higher</b>: Amazing success; completed 100% faster than average with no resources
            consumed.

        <li>
            <b>Fail by 0 or lower</b>: Adequate success; took a little longer than expected with no extra

            <b>Failure by 6 or lower</b>: Sloppy success; took 50% longer than expected and with 50% more

    While anything might be considered a resource, there should generally be no penalty of focus, mana,
    stamina, or health for passing the check. Instead, failure of the bare minimum should set the par
    for what's at risk for your well-being, with each successive grade of failure increasing the penalty
    by 50% and then 100%.
    <p>
        For example, if you would risk 10 points of your health for an adequate success, then a sloppy success
        would penalize 15 points, and a horrible success would take 20.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Battles
    </h3>
    Against a small battle, the DM first summarizes the challenge of the battle to the players as a single
    difficulty score ranging between 8 and 25. Scores between 8 are considered too easy and that the players
    will automatically win, while scores above 18 should be considered too hard and that the players will
    most certainly lose.
    <p>
        Additionally, the DM should quickly summarize the threat of an encounter by how it might tax
        their resources. Unlike in obstacles, even if you win, you will still take damage, and only by a
        perfect success can you get off without penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since there are no fighting talents, the combatants improvise by creating Melee, Magic, and Skill
        talents based on the base starting power values of their classes. For example: <i>A class's starting
        Melee power might be 5, and therefore the Melee talent would also be 5.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        The players choose which of their talents they wish to use and then make the check. No matter what,
        they'll succeed, but based on how well they rolled, the penalties and rewards may vary. Before the
        fight, the players should be told about what damage they might suffer from a normal fight - what
        how much mana, stamina, focus, health, and consumables they might expect to lose.
    </p>
    <ul>

    No matter how poorly everyone rolled, so long as at least one player is left alive, then it's considered
    a victory. Anyone who died expends a revival coin (if they have one) and the adventure moves on.
    <p>
        Rewards are then given out for their success as if they had won the fight normally.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ExperienceAndRewards">
        Experience and Rewards
    </h2>
    At the end of a battle loot from slayed monsters is collected and experience is rewarded.
    Each monster drops their own loot upon death, while each battle has its own loot just for winning. (Where
    that loot comes from, no one knows!)
    <p>
        All experience is collected and then divided equally among the combatants (including the ones who died)
        early on. Loot is presumably collected into a neat pile, at which the characters briefly sit around
        and divide the spoils among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many monsters may have the chance to drop a better spoil of loot. This is done with a luck check,
        and on its monster sheet the chance will be marked with the score that must beaten. Upon beating
        that score, you get the new, better loot drop instead of the other one.
    </p>
    <p>
        After having killed multiple monsters, the DM decide how the loot drops are done.
        There are a few ways, each of which can be fast and/or fun depending on the
        circumstances. Whichever way is decided upon, they DM should stay consistent
        throughout the rest of the game.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Only one check is made as the check for every slain monster.
        </li>
        <li>
            One check is made for every kind of monster.
        </li>
        <li>
            Every monster gets its own check.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each player rolls for the monsters they killed.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the monster was killed by a critical hit, then it grants the
            best drop of loot (assume you rolled a nat 20 for the drop).
        </li>
        <li>
            If a special objective (revealed to the party) was accomplished
            by the time the battle was won, the best loot is dropped from
            all monsters.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>
    Not all campaigns utilize experience points, and that's perfectly okay. Instead, if the campaign is
    utilizing milestones, then after each boss battle, each combatant gets to level-up.
