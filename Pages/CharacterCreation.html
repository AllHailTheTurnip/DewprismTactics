    <p>
        Now that all the players are gathered and your DM has set the stage, it's time for our band of treasure seekers
        to
        finally form. During this initial phase of the game, each player will create a treasure hunter through which
        they'll
        engage in the world. They'll each have a backstory, a personality, a class, stats, abilities, and so on, that,
        as the game proceeds, will grow in strength, endurance, and power, until, ultimately, they're ready to face
        the final opponent and save the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        We'll begin with breaking down the process into three steps.
    </p>

</div>

<div>
    <h2 id="Biography">
        Biography
    </h2>
    <p>
        Start by thinking of who your treasure hunter is and where they come from.
        Are they well-intentioned? Are they on a noble journey to help someone, or are on they looking for personal
        gain?
        Maybe they're out to save themselves from an impossible debt, or to resurrect someone dear?
        <br><br>
        Dewprism is a game about going after the ultimate Relic - a magical item <i>so powerful</i> it is
        can grant any wish - and so your character's motivations should justify them going after it.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will all tie into their behavior around others. Do they work well as a team, listening to
        their friends and heeding their advice, or are they the type to run head-first into danger with the
        only plan being to improvise it all on the fly?
    </p>
    <p>
        In a way, this all ties into their appearance. It's common sense that most people dress the way
        they want others to perceive them, and Dewprism being a JRPG from the late-90's, there's plenty of
        room for creativity. Though the description doesn't have to be too verbose, it should fit comfortably
        into a single sentence. Ultimately, most people - including your fellow treasure hunters - should be able
        to accurately predict what kind of person your treasure hunter is based on their appearance alone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you've figured that all out, go ahead and write down their backstory, behavior, and appearance
        in their respective sections under the Biography section at the top of your character sheet.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Class">
        Class
    </h3>
    Your character's class is going to be the core of their strengths and abilities. Over the course of
    the game you'll go on to become something completely unique that is set apart from all the others.
    <br> But for now, you get to pick one from the base list.
    <p>
        Whatever class you choose, you'll it list as your Primary Class in the Biography section of your
        character sheet, and again on your Classes portion just beneath. With your class you'll write down
        what level you are in it - this called your Class Level, and is separate from your Level attribute.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        Abilities
    </h3>
    Once you take your class, you know all of the abilities that belong to it. Write down the abilities,
    including the Innate Ability, to your character sheet.
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Level">
        Level
    </h3>
    Your level is the strong indicator of how far into their journey your character is. It's a measure of
    strength, endurance, and power. The higher their level, the more formidable a force they are.
    <p> Most likely your party will all be starting at level 1.</p>
    <hr>
    To put things into perspective, you may consider the average townsperson to be level 0 - they
    effectively have only 1 point of health, 1 stamina, mana, and focus, 1 power and 1 evasion for
    their melee, magic, and skill listings, and have no class (and thus no abilities).
</div>

<div>
    <h2 id="VSSAs">VSSAs</h2>
    <p>
        Standing for Vitals, Scores, Stats, and Abilities, your VSSAs (pronounced <i>Vee-suhs or Visas</i>) are the
        center of your character's combative abilities. These scores are all initially determined by your
        starting class, and are continually influenced by the classes they take as they level-up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Referring to your class's documentation, <b>you'll start by copying down its base Vitals, Scores, Stats,
        and Abilities down from it to your character sheet</b>, ignoring any values marked in between parentheses.
        Keep in mind that you'll have a separate sheet for all your abilities, along with another sheet
        (or two) for your sideboarded abilities.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        Vitals
    </h3>
    <p>
        Your vitals section contains four attributes.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Health</b>.<br>
            Representing the amount of punishment you can endure before you are finally defeated. Once it
            reaches 0, you're Knocked-Out (KO'd), and at negative its max value, you're dead.<br>
            This score continually grows over the course of your campaign, and can even reach into the thousands.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Stamina</b>.<br>
            How many points you have to spend on your Melee abilities (if they require any). Actions
            made with stamina are going to be feats of strength, endurance, and power. Once it reaches 0, you
            feel exhausted.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Mana</b>.<br>
            The measure of your mana pool and therefore how many spells you can cast throughout a battle.
            Mana is always used for spellcasting, be it raining fire from the score, turning invisible,
            or healing somebody from the brink of death. When it reaches 0, you're emotionally exhausted.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Focus</b>.<br>
            The measure of your logical and sensory acuteness. In battle, your skill-type abilities, be they
            secret arts or flick-of-the-wrist actions, will depend upon your Focus. Focus is the power of
            knowledge and wisdom, under which you can do incredible things. Once it reaches 0, you feel
            mentally exhausted.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All of these vital values can be restored from a quiet night's rest, or through handy potions.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        Scores
    </h3>
    <p>
        Your scores are generally static, being determined by your primary class and then staying that way.
        They do not grow, though they may be affected by your abilities. <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><a href="TermsAndDefinitions.html#Elements">Element</a></b>.<br>
            Your base element.
            This will determine which attacks you are weak to and which attacks you're strong against.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Initiative</b>.<br>
            Your base bonus to your initiative roll at the start of combat. 0 is normal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Carry</b>.<br>
            How much equipment you can carry on your person at one time. What your outfit
            looks like or how big your pockets are has nothing to do with it (thankfully).
            The value is measured in Units (u), which is approximate to 10ish pounds.
            If you exceed your Carry, your movement and be penalized.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Tool</b>.<br>
            Your equipped tool. It grants a bonus based on its effects.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Melee Damage</b>.<br>
            A value based on your Melee Power, multiplied by the Rank of your equipped Melee-type weapon.
            If no Melee-type weapon is equipped, assume the Rank is 1.
            Melee-type attacks use this as their default damage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Magic Damage</b>.<br>
            A value based on your Magic Power, multiplied by the Rank of your equipped Magic-type weapon.
            If no Magic-type weapon is equipped, assume the Rank is 1.
            Magic-type attacks use this as their default damage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Skill Damage</b>.<br>
            A value based on your Skill Power, multiplied by the Rank of your equipped Skill-type weapon.
            If no Skill-type weapon is equipped, assume the Rank is 1.
            Skill-type attacks use this as their default damage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Crit</b>.<br>
            Beside each damage score is a score called Crit, which stands for Critical Damage.<br>
            Crit is equal to its associated score, where it's weapon's Rank is increased by 1.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Stats</h3>
    Your three primary attack-type scores are listed here.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Melee - Represents your melee attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Magic - Represents your spells.
        </li>
        <li>
            Skill - Represents your skills.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Each attack-type is split into two columns: Power, and Evasion.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Power</b>.<br> Measured as the general effectiveness of your ability.<br>
            Many abilities use it for damage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Evasion</b>.<br> How often you're able to dodge an attack of a certain type.<br>
            The higher the score, the harder it is to hit you.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Abilities</h3>
    Your Abilities list is used to record all your actively used abilities, of which there are 11:
    your Innate ability, and your regular abilities.<br>
    Though very few abilities look completely similar, they do share a set of some common attributes that
    indicate how they're to be used and how they behave in combat.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="TermsAndDefinitions.html#AbilityTerms">Type, Method, and Application</a>.<br>
            These attributes are bundled together at the front of your ability. Type indicates
            how your character uses the ability; method describes the intention
            the ability; and application describes the terms you use it
            under.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Use</b>.<br>
            The general cost and conditions under which an ability is used. Most abilities require
            an amount of AP, and others yet will demand an amount of either, Stamina, Focus, or Mana
            (or all three). Some abilities are limited to an amount of uses per round or day.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The effect of an ability is listed at the end of its notation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since abilities are so data-dense, you can optionally list the bare-bones of the ability
        and reference its full details from the class documentation.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Innate Abilities
    </h4>
    The first item listed in your Abilities list is your class's Innate Ability. This ability is unique
    to your class and will go on to define your character on the battlefield. Unlike regular abilities,
    upon taking a level in a class, you cannot learn this one.<br>
    The Innate ability is always listed at the top of the list and is indexed with a 0.

    <h4>
        Regular Abilities
    </h4>
    <p>
        Regular abilities make up the bulk of your abilities list. From the start, your abilities will be
        comprised of your primary class's abilities. However, as you continue to advance through the
        levels, you'll be able to mix-and-match your learned abilities from other classes.
    </p>
    <p>
        At level 1, as you're recording your abilities for the first time, you may pick an ability to
        learn for future use with other classes. Write this ability down on your sideboard sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember that when mix-and-matching abilities from your sideboard and your primary class, you
        may only substitute up to five of your ten class abilities with your sideboard ones.
    </p>


</div>

<div>
    <h2 id="Equipment">Equipment</h2>
    While out adventuring, it's always good to come equipped. You'll need food, medicine, tools,
    and, most of all, weapons. Beware finding yourself under-equipped while out in the great unknown
    - as it could be days before you can make the trip back to town.
    <p>However, there's a limit to the amount of weight you can carry on your person at once,
        which is dictated to by your class's Carry score. Carrying anything beyond your Carry score
        poses penalties to your Movement scores, which may eventually result in your
        complete immobilization.</p>
    Your equipment section is split into five areas for you to list your stuff in.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Primary Weapon</b><br>
            The weapon in your dominant hand. Attributes listed, aside from its name, are Rank, Use, and Weight.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Secondary Weapon</b><br>
            The weapon in your non-dominant hand. Attributes listed, aside from its name, are Rank, Use, and Weight.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Tools</b><br>
            Your list of tools. Among the variables are listed Weight and effects.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Consumables</b><br>
            Generally anything you can eat or drink, this ranges from sandwiches to magic potions.
            <br>The items are listed as a free-form list, indicating the amount of matching items,
            their names, and effects.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Materials</b><br>
            Collected while out on your adventurers, materials are generally useless until they've
            been taken back to town and given to a craftsman for processing. From there, they can
            be turned into meals, potions, tools, weapons, and other useful things.
            There are six slots of materials:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Meat. The muscle and organs stripped from creatures.<br>
                    A chef/cook can turn it into meals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wood. Includes twigs, logs, and leaves.<br>
                    Typically used in weapons, tools, and housing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fabric. Includes cotton, fur, and silk.<br>
                    Fabric. Includes cotton, fur, and silk.<br>
                    Typically used in clothing and medicine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Metal. Includes iron, bronze, and copper.<br>
                    Used in weapons, tools.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mineral. Includes gems, geodes, and claws.<br>
                    Used in tools and magical weapons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Special. Sometimes there are items that just don't fit in
                    or needs to be marked as unique from the rest.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        There are three attributes for each slot: common, rare, and magic.
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Your Weapon</h3>
    Each treasure hunter comes into the story with naught but the clothes on their backs, their trusty weapon, and
    and anything granted from their background kit.<br>
    No tools, or materials. They even spent their last gil just for the ticket to town! The only place they
    have left to go is up.
    <p>
        What your weapon looks like is up to you - but keep in mind that there will be no other weapon quite like it in
        the land.
        There may be weapons of a similar or same type, but yours is unique! It has <i>you</i> written all over it, and
        has even developed some unique qualities.
    </p>
    <p>In this regard, start by building your weapon. Below is a list of attributes that you select one of each
        from.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Type.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Melee.<br> The weapon is used in melee. Most often a kind of sword, an axe, or a mace.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Magic.<br> The weapon is used in spells. Most often a kind of staff, wand, or magical item.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Skill.<br> The weapon is used in skills. Most often a ranged weapon like a whip, throwing star,
                    or a bow.
                </li>
            </ul>

        Background Kit
    </h3>
    When starting a campaign, you don't always have to start in the same destitute condition. Instead,
    if the DM wills it, each player can start out with a kit of support items and some money to help
    get them started.

        Starting the Adventure
    </h2>
    Now that you know who your character is, where they've come from, and why they're on this quest,
    you should work together with the other players - including the DM - on how all of your character come
    together for the campaign.
    <p>
        Typically, it begins with sail boat coming in from along the coast. Each of the characters are
        at the end of a two-year long journey, in which the little town they're venturing to is their last
        chance. During that time on the boat, they might have had some chances to get exchange glances
        do greetings.
    </p>
    <p>
        How it all happens is up to the players. Once the boat lands in port, the game begins for real.
        Happy adventuring!
